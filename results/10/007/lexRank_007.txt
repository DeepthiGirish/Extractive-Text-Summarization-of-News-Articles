Fox attacks Blair's Tory 'lies'  Tony Blair lied when he took the UK to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign, say the Tories.
Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents' policies and then attacking the lies.
"What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear," he told BBC News.

Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. Mr MacDonell said: "I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. " Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland's fight against binge drinking.

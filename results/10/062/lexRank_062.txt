In Rochdale, the Liberal Democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour - secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than Labour's Lorna Fitzsimons.
Last year MAB, which opposed the war in Iraq, urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections.
But a spokesman stressed the meeting was "not necessarily anti-Labour".

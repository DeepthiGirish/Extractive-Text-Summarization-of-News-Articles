The men were arrested in September after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted.
Speaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder.
In November, the use of the Parliament Act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales.

The proposed scheme would mean voters using individual "identifiers" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system. And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check.

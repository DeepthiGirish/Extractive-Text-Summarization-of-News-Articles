Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.
Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.
But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead.

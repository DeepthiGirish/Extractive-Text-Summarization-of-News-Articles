Welsh councils should set their taxes at "reasonable levels" after being given an average funding increase of 6%, says the assembly government."It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase."Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding.Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change "is taking spin to the very verge of deception".

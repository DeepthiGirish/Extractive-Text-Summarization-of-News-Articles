Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was "out of control" during the "wild" 1960s." He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a "set-up" but he then realised all the dates fitted." Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children.

 A report by the Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks. The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the "abandonment option", to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work. It blamed the agency's senior management for a "multitude of problems" within the agency, including for an apparent lack of training of frontline staff.

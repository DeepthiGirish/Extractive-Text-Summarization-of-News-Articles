Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force. Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts. He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police "in the near future" to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.

Howard unveils election platform  The Conservatives would stand up for the "forgotten majority", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.
The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values.
In a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the "forgotten majority" made up the backbone of Britain.

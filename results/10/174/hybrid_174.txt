First Minister Jack McConnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded. An executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report. "But at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised. "They do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision.

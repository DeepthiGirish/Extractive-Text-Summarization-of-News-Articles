 The Countryside Alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on Wednesday when the Appeal Court ruled the Hunting Act was lawful.But the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits.Anti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law.

A chief constable has backed the introduction of 24-drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change.The Metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24-hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking "epidemic". However, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24-hour drinking.

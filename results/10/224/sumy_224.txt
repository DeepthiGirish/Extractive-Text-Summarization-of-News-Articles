Detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws, the UK's highest court has ruled.The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge.In a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: "I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones."

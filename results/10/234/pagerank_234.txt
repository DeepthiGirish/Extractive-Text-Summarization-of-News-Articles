Mr Blunkett said he wanted "to go back to a time when I was very young, when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work".The best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms, he said, but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed.Mr Blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police.

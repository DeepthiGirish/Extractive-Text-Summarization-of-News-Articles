A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty. We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue. We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq. We are challenging the use of the Parliament Act 1949 in a High Court action. Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that.

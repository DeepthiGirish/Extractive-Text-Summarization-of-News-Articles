A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.Here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected Spring poll.We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs.Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time.(Rural affairs minister) Alun Michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult.It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face.We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors.Fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers.Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about Â£750.

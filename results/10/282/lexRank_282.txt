The prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure.
Mr Brown warned that the Tories were planning "the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto".
In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education.

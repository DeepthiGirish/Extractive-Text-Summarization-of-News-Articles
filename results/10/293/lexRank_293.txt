He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for "truth" - would avoid the old parties' "lies and spin".
Kilroy Silk has secured my vote, and many more like me.
Trouble is, any votes he collects may just end up helping New Labour into a third term.
Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk.
UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.
Someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of UKIP's democratic nature.
UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU.
The closer to straight-down-the-middle the better, as far as I am concerned, but in any eventuality, the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.
He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.
I've always thought that Kilroy-Silk was a self-publicising, egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.
This new party might gain support from right-wing England, but will have little impact in Wales or Scotland.
It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.
England needs Europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, we can't rely on the USA forever!
This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy.

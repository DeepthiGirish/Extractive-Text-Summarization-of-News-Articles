Tory work and pensions spokesman David Willetts said families affected by CSA failings would wonder why Mr Smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced.The work and pensions committee launched their inquiry into the CSA's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was still building up.The MPs found American IT giant EDS' Â£456m system was "nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate".

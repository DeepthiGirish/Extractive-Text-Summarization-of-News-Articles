Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. "He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye'," he said.

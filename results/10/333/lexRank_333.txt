The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to "change the face" of UK politics.
UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.
UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.

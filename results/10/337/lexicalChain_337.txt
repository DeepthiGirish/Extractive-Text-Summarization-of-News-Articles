A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. "If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned," said Mr Jones.

The party's scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder. Party leader Charles Kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government. Under the plan, councils secure deals with developers where they keep a 1% share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market.

The Lib Dems say their "mutual homes" would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs.Party leader Charles Kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government.Mr Hill said he also asked whether the Lib Dems would match Labour's promise to spend Â£42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.

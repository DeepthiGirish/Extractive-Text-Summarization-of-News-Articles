The idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of "real" voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras.
Mr Blair told prospective Labour MPs on Thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could "enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment".
Mr Blair recalls how Bill Clinton once advised him: "Always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day."
Former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public.

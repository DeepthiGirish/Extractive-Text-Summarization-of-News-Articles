During his 49 minute speech Mr Brown told MPs he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004.
In contrast, the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from Â£4,745 to Â£4,895 next month.
Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy attacked Mr Brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice.
Mr Brown put 1p a pint on beer, 4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until September.

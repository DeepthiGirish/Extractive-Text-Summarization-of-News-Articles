Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.He says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future. "For example, we could send the target (Conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the Tories to Labour explaining the reasons why voting Tory is a bad idea or we could send Labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote. "As the information commissioner himself has said, if people are not marketing something, if they are asking them which way they are going to vote, they are not in breach of the law.

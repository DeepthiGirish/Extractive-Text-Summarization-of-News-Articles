Sacked MP Howard Flight's local Conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election. Mr Hilton was chosen to fight the seat after the previous candidate, Robert Oulds, was sacked for being pictured with a range of guns and a hunting knife. He said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the BBC News website on Monday evening.

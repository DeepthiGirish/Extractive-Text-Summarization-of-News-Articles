 The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as "desperate", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected. "We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra Â£1,400." She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. "While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be," he said.

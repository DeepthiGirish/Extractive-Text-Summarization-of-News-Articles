 The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the "e-mail regime" could "support the freedom of information regime". All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.

The prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974.In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved "to be completely and publicly exonerated".However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology.Mr Blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would "ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them".Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son.

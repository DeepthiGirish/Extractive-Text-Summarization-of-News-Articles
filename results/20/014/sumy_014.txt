Mr Blair's refusal to accept the Tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords.The bill proposes "control orders", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use.These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio Four's the World at One his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice."I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk," said Mr Blair.

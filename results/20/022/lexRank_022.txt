Nat Insurance to rise, say Tories  National Insurance will be raised if Labour wins the next election, Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed.
The Tories have promised Â£4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall.
"When we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted," he said.
Mr Howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the European Council of Ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the EU.

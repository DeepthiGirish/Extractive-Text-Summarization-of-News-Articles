 The Commons education select committee called this "morally indefensible" but the government said the e-University project had "improved understanding". She added: "UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom. With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had "too much freedom to spend public money as it wished", the report found." The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but "should learn the lessons from this disaster".

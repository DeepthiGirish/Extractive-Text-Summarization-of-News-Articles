E-University 'disgraceful waste'  A failed government scheme to offer UK university courses online has been branded a "disgraceful waste" by MPs.
The e-University was scrapped last year, having attracted only 900 students at a cost of Â£50m.
Chief executive John Beaumont was paid a bonus of Â£44,914, despite a failure to bring in private sector backers.

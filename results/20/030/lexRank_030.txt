It is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day.
Parenting contracts, penalty notices and "fast track" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem.
Previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics.
Those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically.

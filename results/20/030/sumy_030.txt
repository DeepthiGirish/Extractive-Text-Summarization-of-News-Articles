Parenting contracts, penalty notices and "fast track" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem.Tories say Labour's previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school.In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved.Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school.Held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school.

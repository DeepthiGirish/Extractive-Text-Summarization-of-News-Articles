The home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as "a mess".On Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales. But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: "Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence.

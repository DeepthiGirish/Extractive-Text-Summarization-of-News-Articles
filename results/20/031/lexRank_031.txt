The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases.
But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be "dragged" to face MPs.
Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was "indefensible and should cease".
But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: "Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence.
The panel suggested different kinds of murders could be "graded" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.

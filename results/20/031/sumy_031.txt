David Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced "prematurely" via press release a review of murder laws.In its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder.The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases.But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: "Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence.The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.

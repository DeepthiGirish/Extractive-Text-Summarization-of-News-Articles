On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using "grossly disproportionate" force could be prosecuted.
The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law.
The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr Clarke.

The House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.
He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court.
In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: "I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.
"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation.

Anglers 'could face prosecution'  Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.
Sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said.
The MPs said they were "concerned" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare.
They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, MPs said.
They called for a "cast-iron guarantee" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing.

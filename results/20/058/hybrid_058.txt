In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. The EU's move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a "product of the Cold War". He said "it is more likely than not" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July."Mr Straw said the US government was suspicious of "the motives of some other countries within the EU" in wanting the ban lifted.

The Darlington Council spokesman added: "Initially we had complaints from a couple of residents in Mowden to say they thought they should have had their ballot papers by now.
"We are working closely with the council and will do all we can to help rectify the problem.
"This is affecting several hundred properties, which have failed to receive ballot papers.
She said the commission was satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure all voters received ballot papers in time.

It is not known whether the other two men released from the Cuba detention camp in January - Richard Belmar and Moazzam Begg - have also received letters.The Liberal Democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the US in order for the men to be allowed home from Guantanamo Bay.Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture.He added: "The power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and I find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time."Amnesty International UK also questioned whether the decisions had been based on "torture evidence" obtained at Guantanamo Bay.

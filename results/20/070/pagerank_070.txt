Michael Howard said he would not back the Home Secretary's plans for "control orders" which include home detention.Home Secretary Charles Clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the Egyptian man, known only as C, certified as a terrorist suspect.The Conservatives have expressed "serious misgivings" about government plans for keeping UK and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.Mr Clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk.Controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the UK without trial or charge since December 2001 was freed from jail.

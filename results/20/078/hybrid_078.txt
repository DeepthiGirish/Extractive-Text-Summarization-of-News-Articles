 But the Home Office says it may be in the children's best interests if it reunites them with their communities. 'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children "and leave them to rot". "From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account," said Mr Hogg. "The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries." A spokesman for the Albanian embassy in London said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.

'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision."The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania."We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused," said the spokesman."The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries."A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children "and leave them to rot".The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.

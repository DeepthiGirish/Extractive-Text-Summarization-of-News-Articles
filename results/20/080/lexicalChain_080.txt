The National Audit Office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year. Auditor General Sir John Bourn said: "Higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit England both socially and economically. When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was "only the start of the journey". The qualifications achieved by those taking part in the government's scheme range up to GCSE equivalents. Education minister Ivan Lewis said: "We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace. " Shadow Education Secretary Tim Collins said: "This is the third report in two days to highlight Labour's failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life. "Employers and business leaders have repeatedly voiced concern over the number of school-leavers without these basic skills, but all the government have offered is more talk.

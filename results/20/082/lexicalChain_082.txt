Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution. His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Tories of "running scared" of debate. "Isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election. " The proposed question for the constitution referendum is: "Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union. The government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the Tories set to campaign for a "no" vote. The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade.

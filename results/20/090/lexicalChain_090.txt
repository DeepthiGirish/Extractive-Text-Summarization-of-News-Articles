Experts studying the seas off Scotland's west coast have already forecast more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc across the country last month. The project was conducted jointly by the Environmental Research Institute in Thurso, which is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) Millennium Institute network, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre.

Gordon Brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and Tony Blair was harming the workings of government.Under the plans, unveiled in the Gershon report, some 84,000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services.On Wednesday, ahead of the Chancellor's pre-Budget report, Mr Baume told BBC News there were sometimes "conflicting and competing agendas for government" between Number 10 and the Treasury."The problem is that on many occasions these two don't add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle."

The Conservative Party would cut the number of MPs by about one-fifth if they were elected, Tory leader Michael Howard has said. Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. The changes would all take place within five years of the Conservatives winning a general election, Mr Howard told the paper. Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers.

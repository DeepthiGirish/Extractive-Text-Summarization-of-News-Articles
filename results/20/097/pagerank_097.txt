Home Secretary Charles Clarke told the Times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached.But he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees' home countries could be difficult.The BBC's home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett.But the Liberal Democrat's shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.

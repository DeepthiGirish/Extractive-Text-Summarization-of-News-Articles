Ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated.A report by the Fraser of Allander Institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research.But the Scottish National Party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy.Ms Sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive's support for the policy, there were questions which needed to be answered and, if necessary, sums redone.

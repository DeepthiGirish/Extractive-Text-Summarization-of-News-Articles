Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.
Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.
But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead.
Mr Mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview.
The home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not "well informed".
Guantanamo man 'suing government'  A British terror suspect held in Guantanamo Bay for 33 months plans to sue the government, it is reported.

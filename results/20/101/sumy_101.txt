Welsh councils should set their taxes at "reasonable levels" after being given an average funding increase of 6%, says the assembly government.The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that "significant" cuts to services may still be unavoidable."It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase."On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds.Plaid Cymru's local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement "hugely disappointing".Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding.Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change "is taking spin to the very verge of deception".

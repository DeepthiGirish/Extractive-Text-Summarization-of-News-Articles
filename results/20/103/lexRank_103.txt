"Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity."
The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.
Payment levels vary from area to area, with some carers getting just Â£50 a week for clothes, food and other costs.
Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers' allowances would be as fair as possible.

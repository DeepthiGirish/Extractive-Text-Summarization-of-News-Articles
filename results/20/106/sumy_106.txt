Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's "chaotic" asylum system under Tony Blair.The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997."The anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution," he was due to say.Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees."If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven," said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council.Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.

He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader.
UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU.
It came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.
Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes.
As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe.
This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party.
Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.
The party asserts that Mr Hockney "has a moral obligation, if not a legal one" to stand down.
It is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP.
Every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country.
UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been "straightforward" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.

Blair 'damaged' by Blunkett row  A majority of voters (68%) believe the prime minister has been damaged by the row over David Blunkett's involvement in a visa application, a poll suggests.
A majority, 52%, said Chancellor Gordon Brown had done a good job and just 16% disagreed.
Three-quarters said Mr Blunkett was right to go to court for the right to see Mrs Quinn's son - whom he says he fathered - and just 14% voiced sympathy for Mrs Quinn.
But nearly half those surveyed said Mr Blunkett should return to Cabinet if Labour won the next election.

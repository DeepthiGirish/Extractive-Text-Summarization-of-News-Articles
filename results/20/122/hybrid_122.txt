Non-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives. Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS.The proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. The proposals include:- People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a "high incidence TB country" will have to undergo a chest X-ray.  - People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to "demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health".  - They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to "impose significant costs or demands" on the NHS.

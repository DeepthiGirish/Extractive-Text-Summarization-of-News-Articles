"Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad," said Mr Howard.Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS."In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status," she said.But Mr Howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants' claims.A positive test for TB would mean visa applications being turned down, while HIV would be dealt with case by case.The proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching.

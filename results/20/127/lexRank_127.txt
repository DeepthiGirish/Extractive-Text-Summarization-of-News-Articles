Brown to outline presidency goals  Next year will be "make or break" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.
The chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005.
They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations.
Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.
He also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria.
The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue.

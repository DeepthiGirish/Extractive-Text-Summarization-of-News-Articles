All three parties have been wooing older voters with both the Tories and Lib Dems pledging higher pensions.Mr Johnson's speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country's pension system.The government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were "increasingly consigned to the past"."We're sweeping them away entirely for people under 65, and we're giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously.

"You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one," he said.
Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them.
The Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend.
We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again," hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said.

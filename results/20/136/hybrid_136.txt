Moves to lift the European Union's ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives.In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. In the UK, more export licences were refused under the existing European Union arms code than under the embargo, he said. And only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code. The decision could undermine Nato as it severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the ban.Mr Ancram argued: "What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted.

Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Britain had to set an example when it assumed the EU presidency."Departments responsible for administering EU funds need to make sure that they're doing everything possible to weed out improper spending."The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management."A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO's assessment of fraud reporting.

The question to be asked in the referendum on the EU Constitution has been unveiled by the government.The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote in the referendum, expected in 2006.Jack Straw, who argues the constitution reflected a "British vision for Europe" and gives "national governments a stronger grip", has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006.But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as "two separate issues".Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who backs the constitution, said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year.

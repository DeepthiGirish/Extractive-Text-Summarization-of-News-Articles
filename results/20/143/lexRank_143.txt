Shahid Malik, who is on Labour's ruling NEC, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities.
Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.
"We haven't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this," he said.
Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added.

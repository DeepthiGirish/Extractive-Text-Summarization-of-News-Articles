Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back.
But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats.
The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme.
In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a "sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries".

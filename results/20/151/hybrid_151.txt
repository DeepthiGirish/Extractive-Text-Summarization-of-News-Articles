 But Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. Police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the UK. In an interview with the Independent, Sir John said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the UK. Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them. The Pentagon says they were freed after the UK government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the US or any of its allies. "We want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family," said Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the council.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers.The government's new five-year plan is designed to show how Labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election, expected to be held in May. "The public are worried about this, they are worried rightly, because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system. Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair." Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis said the government had failed to remove 250,000 failed asylum seekers from the UK and limits on economic migrants had been a "shambles".

Mayor will not retract Nazi jibe  London mayor Ken Livingstone has again refused to retract a Nazi insult made to a Jewish reporter.
Labour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is "standing by" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a "concentration camp guard".
At his weekly press conference on Tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise.
He said to media representatives: "If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong."

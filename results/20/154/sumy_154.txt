London mayor Ken Livingstone has again refused to retract a Nazi insult made to a Jewish reporter.Labour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is "standing by" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a "concentration camp guard".On Tuesday, the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly.Two motions were passed by the London Assembly, which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayor's activities, on Monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments.The mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of "examples of intrusion by journalists" into his, and his family's private life.On tape Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking reporter Oliver Finegold if he is a "German war criminal".

Howard unveils election platform  The Conservatives would stand up for the "forgotten majority", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.
The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values.
In a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the "forgotten majority" made up the backbone of Britain.
Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans.
In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people.
Labour says the document offers only a return to a "failed Tory past".

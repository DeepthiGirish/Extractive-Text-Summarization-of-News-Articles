The government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the TUC has said. "Workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety."Rory O' Neill, editor of union-backed Hazards magazine, which conducted the research, said: "Giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win." The TUC has called on the government to appoint "roving" safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections.

At least three people from Scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list, the first minister has told MSPs. He said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police.Mr McConnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better. Mr McConnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the Make Poverty History campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities, trade unions and churches in the run-up to the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July.

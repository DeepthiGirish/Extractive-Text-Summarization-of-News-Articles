"The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low. "I accept the need to improve housing supply but, as things stand, the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers, with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser." Points raised in the report included: - No proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence.  - Measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered - including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero-emissions homes.

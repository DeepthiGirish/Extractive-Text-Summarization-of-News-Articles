"But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate," said the assembly government.The contract with the Powys health board was worth Â£7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients.Mr Williams had said he did not think it was a Welsh-English issue, but said Hereford hospital was "struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to Powys".Andy Williams, chief executive of Powys Local Health Board, had said it was "a totally unacceptable way to behave".But after the hospital had agreed to the suspension, Mr Williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure Welsh patients continued to be treated there.

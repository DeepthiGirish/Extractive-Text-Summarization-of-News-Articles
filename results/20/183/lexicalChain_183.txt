Former Northern Ireland minister Sir Nicholas Scott has died at a London hospice, his family has announced. As a Northern Ireland minister he dealt with education and later security where he rode out the mass IRA escape from the Maze in 1983. Sir Nicholas was a strong defender of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was held in esteem in Dublin government and SDLP circles. Sir Nicholas was replaced as the member for Kensington and Chelsea by the flamboyant Alan Clark, after being deselected by his constituency in December 1996.

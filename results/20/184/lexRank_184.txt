Lord Goldsmith has denied being "leaned on" and says the words written were his.
Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.
"In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions," he said.
The government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.
"And this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister."

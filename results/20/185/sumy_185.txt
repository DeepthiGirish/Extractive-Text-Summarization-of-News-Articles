Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to homes in south Wales opposing plans for a new mosque.Taha Idris, director of the Swansea Bay Race Equality Council, said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public.The BNP website carries a photograph of party leader Nick Griffin - who lives near Welshpool, mid Wales - delivering the leaflet.The BNP has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion, but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest.Following the death earlier this year of Kalan Kawa Karim, an Iraqi Kurd living in Swansea, it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than 1,000 people.

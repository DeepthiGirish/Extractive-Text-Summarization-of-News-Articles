Mr Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was "fractured, divided and uncertain", Mr Blair said.Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an "umbilical cord" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.Mr Bush's first task was to "rebuild a sense of domestic purpose" within the US, he said.Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.

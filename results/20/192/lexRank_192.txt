Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as "long overdue".
Director Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to "practise what it preaches" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons.
Guantanamo four free in weeks  All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.
Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years.
They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led "war on terror".
Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after "intensive and complex discussions" over security.

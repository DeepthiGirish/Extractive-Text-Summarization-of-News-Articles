A chief constable has backed the introduction of 24-drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change. His comments come after the Liberal Democrats backed Tory demands that the government's plans be put on hold.The Metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24-hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking "epidemic". However, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24-hour drinking. The Conservatives have called for 24-hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved. Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: "It would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours.

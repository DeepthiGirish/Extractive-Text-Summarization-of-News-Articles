The Metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24-hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking "epidemic".A chief constable has backed the introduction of 24-drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change.He said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation.However, Mr Hayman said: "It would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say, 'I'm very sorry'.Andy Hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans, which come into force on 7 February.

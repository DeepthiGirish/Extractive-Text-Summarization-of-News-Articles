Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at Guantanamo Bay and terror suspects detained without trial in the UK.His comments follow news that all four Britons held by the US in the Cuban camp will be freed within weeks. On Tuesday Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons that the US had agreed to release the four after "intensive and complex discussions" over security. In December the House of Lords, the UK's highest court, ruled that the anti-terror measures broke human rights laws." Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, has called on the government to "practise what it preaches" and either free or charge the detained men.

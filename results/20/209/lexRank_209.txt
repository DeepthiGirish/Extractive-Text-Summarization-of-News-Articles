Abbas 'will not tolerate' attacks  Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said he will not tolerate attacks such as last Friday's suicide bombing in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
Tuesday's meeting on Palestinian reform is being hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) was exerting "a 100% effort" to end the violence, Mr Abbas added.
The attack, which killed five, was the first of its kind since he took office.

Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: "Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.
The committee also highlighted "deeply worrying" cases of children and young people taking their own lives.
The joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems.
Members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals.

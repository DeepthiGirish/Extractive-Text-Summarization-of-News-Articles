Anyone planning to move to the UK will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: "Whilst it is good that Labour has rejected the Tory idea of quotas on asylum, the jury is still out on the Home Office's ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system."Mr Clarke, who will unveil his plans on Monday, said economic migration helped the UK but "needed proper policing".The Refugee Council said Mr Howard's proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the UK.

The home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws.Mr Clarke's comments came in response to an emergency question from Liberal Democrat constitutional affairs spokesman David Heath.He said he accepted the difficult balance between the nation's security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made "no contingency plans for the present circumstances".Shadow home secretary David Davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of the judgment and urged the government to move as fast as "competently possible" to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice.The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge.

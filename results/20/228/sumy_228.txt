The Labour Party has been accused of anti-Semitism over a poster depicting Michael Howard and Oliver Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs.Prospective Tory candidate Andrew Mennear, whose Finchley constituency contains a large Jewish community, branded it "tasteless" and offensive.The poster shows the two men's faces superimposed on winged pigs and says "the day the Tory sums add up"."It is possible the posters were designed for maximum impact, but this one clearly overstepped the mark and should be withdrawn."

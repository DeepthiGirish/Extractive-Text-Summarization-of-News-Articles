The councils' umbrella organisation Cosla, which provided BBC Scotland with the indicative figures for next year, warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services.The finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased."However, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services," a Cosla spokesman said.Council tax in Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.There are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced.

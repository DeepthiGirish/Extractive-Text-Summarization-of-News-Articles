 This will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. They will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support. Once we've got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters.Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue. He said the UK had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.That the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment. We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq. Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. When the ban comes into force on 18 February we will be going to the European Court because no compensation is being paid.It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face. He wanted the issue off the table until after the election. We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK. Thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. The idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians. It's very much the language being used by the main political parties.We will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press.

The chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo Alan Milburn for a Labour poster launch this week.The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour.It has caused a new wave of concern among Labour MPs gearing up to defend their seats in an election, widely expected to be held in May, and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the PLP meeting.Health Secretary John Reid earlier warned that Labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation.He told BBC News: "Those who co-operate or inspire these books, in my view, have to know that, whatever the short-term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure, they always do it by damaging the record, the unity and the re-election chances of the Labour Party and the government."

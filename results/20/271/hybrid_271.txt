The money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives' spending plans. "So part of the Â£12bn we are going to apply to filling the government's black hole, reducing the borrowing.Mr Howard said: "All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less." However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: "None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is Â£35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard." A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century.

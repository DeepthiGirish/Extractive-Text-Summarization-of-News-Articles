Howard dismisses Tory tax fears  Michael Howard has dismissed fears from some Conservatives that his plans for Â£4bn tax cuts are too modest.
He defended the package, saying it was a plan for the Tories' first Budget and he hoped to be able to go further.
The Tories on Monday highlighted Â£35bn in "wasteful" spending they would stop to allow tax cuts, reduced borrowing and more spending on key services.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats say the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services.

The lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups, Amnesty International's chief has said.Ms Khan highlighted detentions without trial, including those at the US camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems.The Amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism."Public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups," she said.Ms Khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife.

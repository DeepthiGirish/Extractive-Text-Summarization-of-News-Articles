Blair sees greater Bush consensus  George W Bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as US President, Tony Blair has said.
The prime minister said Mr Bush had learned military force was not the only way to fight terrorism.
He understood that "the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights", Mr Blair told the Guardian newspaper.

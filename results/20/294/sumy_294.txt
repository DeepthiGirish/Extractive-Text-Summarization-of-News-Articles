The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented "a formidable force" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election.A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night.

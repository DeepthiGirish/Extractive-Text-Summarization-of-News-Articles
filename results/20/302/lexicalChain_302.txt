Mr Galloway, who on Thursday won Â£150,000 in libel damages from the Daily Telegraph said he would contest Bethnal Green, in London, for Respect. The party's declared aims are an end to the occupation of Iraq, the repeal of anti-union laws and the end of privatisation. " In June's European Parliament elections, Respect failed to gain enough votes for an MEP but did come first in Tower Hamlets borough, most of which is covered by the Commons constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow. Mr Galloway said that in next year's expected general election and local elections a year later, the party would "turn the East End of London into a fortress". Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have chosen prospective parliamentary candidates for Bethnal Green and Bow from the Bangladeshi population, which makes up almost half the electorate.

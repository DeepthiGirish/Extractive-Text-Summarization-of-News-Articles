Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a "decisive blow" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out."Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote."Labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to Incapacity Benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system.

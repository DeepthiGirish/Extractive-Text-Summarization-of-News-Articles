The Audit Commission found the whole local government finance system was "fundamentally flawed" and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change. They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a Â£100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be "radical reform". A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made. The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax.

Anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12.9%.Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be "radical reform".A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made.The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax.Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of Â£500.

A group of MPs has tried to raise the pressure on Tony Blair over reform to the House of Lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the Lords. The group says the British public and a clear majority of MPs support replacing the Lords with a largely-elected second chamber. Mr Clarke said the issue "went to the heart of reforming the health of the British political system". And Mr Tyler said the prime minister's view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the Lords was flawed. The Elect the Lords Campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate.

This is nearly half of the Â£11,724,929 received by 16 political parties listed by the Electoral Commission. Lord Drayson, whose company PowderJect won multi-million pound contracts to provide smallpox vaccine to the government after the 11 September terror attacks, gave Â£500,000 to the party just days before Christmas. The totals for the fourth quarter were well up on the same period of 2003, as the parties built up their war chests for the general election campaign. There were also donations topping Â£250,000 for the Conservatives from Scottish Business Groups Focus on Scotland and the Institute of International Research, the world's largest independent conference company. This was a fee the firm paid for a room for an event held with the work and skills foundation during the party's conference.

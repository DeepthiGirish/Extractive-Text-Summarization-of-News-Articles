The Tories say ministers must respond in Parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the Iraq war was drawn up at Number 10. But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.Mr Sands told Newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case, in case legal action was taken against the UK over the war. "The public interest, which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice, can only be served now by the fullest disclosure. This would be wrong even if Lord Goldsmith had signed the statement, Mr Cook said, because the attorney general's advice should be an "independent legal opinion", not subject to "political negotiation of this kind".

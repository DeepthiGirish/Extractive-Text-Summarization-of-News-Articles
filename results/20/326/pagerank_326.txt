The prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the Tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament.He didn't say so, but the Tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election And they believe Tony Blair is using the issue to suggest the Tories are soft on terrorism.Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue.So who, if anyone, is playing politics with the security of the nation?

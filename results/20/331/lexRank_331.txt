The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: "2+2=5".
Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: "It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches."
Mr Temko said he blamed "cock-up not conspiracy", saying he did not detect inherent anti-Semitism in any of the parties' election campaigns.
The poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election.
Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies.

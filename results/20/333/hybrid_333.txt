Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to "change the face" of UK politics. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. "He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye'," he said.

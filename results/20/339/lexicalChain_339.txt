The party's scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder. Party leader Charles Kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government. Under the plan, councils secure deals with developers where they keep a 1% share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market. "This is typical of Lib Dem hypocrisy," said Tory shadow local government secretary Caroline Spelman. "They claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder, but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market. " The flagship Tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes.

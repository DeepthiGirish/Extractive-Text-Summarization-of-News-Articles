 The Votes at 16 alliance said it was a good thing to "engage people" by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective. "We would hope that the government will table a bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for a reduction in the voting age. That is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place. The commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age.

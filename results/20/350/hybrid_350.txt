Gordon Brown has delivered a rousing speech to Labour's spring conference setting out the government's agenda for the next general election.The chancellor said he was proud of his party's record on the economy, and would strive for continuing stability if elected.Analysing Mr Brown's position before the speech, BBC correspondent James Hardy said Mr Brown would draw "sharp dividing lines" with the Conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. But commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether, as the Conservatives claim, he plans to raise tax after the election. Mr Blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected May election.

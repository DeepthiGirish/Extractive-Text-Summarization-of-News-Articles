Gordon Brown has delivered a rousing speech to Labour's spring conference setting out the government's agenda for the next general election. Analysing Mr Brown's position before the speech, BBC correspondent James Hardy said Mr Brown would draw "sharp dividing lines" with the Conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. But commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether, as the Conservatives claim, he plans to raise tax after the election. The prime minister's enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed, Alan Milburn, Labour's election strategist told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday. The Conservatives and Lib Dems said the pledges - set to underpin Labour's election campaign - were "worthless".

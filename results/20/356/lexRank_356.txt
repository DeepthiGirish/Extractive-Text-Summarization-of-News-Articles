Blair backs 'pre-election budget'  Tony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.
And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced.
Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were "affordable" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising.
David Page, of Investec Securities, said: "His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of Â£8bn is way too optimistic.
In a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity.

Tony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the "cornerstone" of Labour's programme.In a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months "a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term".Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his "golden rule".

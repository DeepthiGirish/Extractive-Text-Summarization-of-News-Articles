The central government cash is part of a Â£1bn package to help local authorities in England keep next year's council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year.
Mr Raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.
Gordon Brown reallocated Â£512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-Budget report on Thursday.
Mr Raynsford said he had held some "pretty frank discussions" with fellow ministers over the plans.

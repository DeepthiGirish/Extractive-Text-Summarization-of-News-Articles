The move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud.
It said incentives to register, such as Â£20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as "gimmicks" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said.
ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could "dramatically reduce the chances of fraud".
Instead they called for "imaginative campaigns" to boost interest.
But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.

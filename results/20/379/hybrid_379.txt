Terrorists might try to target the UK in the run-up to the election, London's most senior police officer has said.Sir Ian Blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the Madrid bomb on Spain's general election last year. Other potential targets were the royal wedding and the UK's presidency of the European Union and G8, he said. Sir Ian told a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority it would be "unwise" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack."This year we are responsible for the EU presidency, presidency of the G8, a royal wedding and a general election." The spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign.

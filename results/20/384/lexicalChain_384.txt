UK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary. Mr Clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan without them facing torture or death. Under the proposed changes - prompted by the House of Lords ruling - the home secretary could order British citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet. Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith said the plans were a "further abuse of human rights in Britain". " He accepted the law lords' ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists. " He suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court.

UK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.Charles Clarke's planned "control orders" mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest, curfews or tagging.Deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in Belmarsh Prison in London under the current laws introduced after the US terror attacks on 11 September 2001.Mr Clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan without them facing torture or death.Mr Clarke also said intelligence reports showed some British nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats.Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis was worried about extending special powers to cover British citizens.

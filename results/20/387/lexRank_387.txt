Pre-poll clash on tax and spend  Labour and the Tories have clashed over tax and spending plans as the row over Gordon Brown's Budget turned into a full scale pre-election battle.
Tony Blair claimed a Tory government would "cut" Â£35bn from public services hitting schools, hospitals and police.
Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin also predicted Mr Brown would have to raise taxes by Â£10bn or Â£11bn if Labour was re-elected because he was borrowing and spending too much.
The chancellor meanwhile insisted his spending plans were "affordable".

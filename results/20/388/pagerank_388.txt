Elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.The Tories say people who pay for three years' long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives.They also want to set up a new "half-way house" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that "individual budget".Ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes.There are 1.7m people needing care in England and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050.

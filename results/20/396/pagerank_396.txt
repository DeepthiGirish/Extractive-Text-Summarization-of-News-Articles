The information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the Lib Dems about how Labour uses its call centres.A party official said there was only scattered evidence of the Tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about Labour.The Lib Dems say Labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls.His letter to the commissioner quotes from a Labour Party handbook about "identifying target voters"."For example, we could send the target (Conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the Tories to Labour explaining the reasons why voting Tory is a bad idea or we could send Labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote."And it quotes a Stevenage Labour Party members' newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.Labour denies breaking rules.

Labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on "cold calling" householders.Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has written to the watchdog accusing Labour of a "flagrant and systematic breach" of the laws governing the TPS.And it quotes a Stevenage Labour Party members' newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.Mr Taylor tells the commissioner: "It is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the Labour Party is engaging in a large-scale voter ID project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings.A party official said there was only scattered evidence of the Tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about Labour.A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it was examining one complaint about political calls - understood to be Mr Taylor's.Labour says it avoids those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making "voter identification" calls.

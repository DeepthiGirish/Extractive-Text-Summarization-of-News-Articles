Eight out of 10 voters do not trust politicians to tell the truth, a new poll conducted for the BBC suggests.But according to the BBC poll, 61% said the issue of trust made no difference to whether or not they would vote at the next election, widely expected on 5 May. And the Green Party unveiled a billboard opposite the Palace of Westminster accusing the government of lying over the Iraq war. She said she did not feel her own colleagues could be trusted, but suggested the "three-cornered relationship" between the press, politicians and the public had a hand in the issue. The public was often turned off by sitting on the sidelines in "the battle of words" between the politician and the journalist, she added.

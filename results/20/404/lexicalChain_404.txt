Danny Kruger, who also works in the Tory research unit, had been due to take on Tony Blair in Sedgefield. Mr Kruger was quoted in the Guardian newspaper saying: "We plan to introduce a period of creative destruction in the public services. "However, in order to avoid any further misrepresentation of his views and any damage to the Party, he has decided not to stand in the Sedgefield constituency at the next election. Labour election coordinator Alan Milburn claimed Mr Kruger had exposed the Tory agenda for Â£35bn of cuts to public services.

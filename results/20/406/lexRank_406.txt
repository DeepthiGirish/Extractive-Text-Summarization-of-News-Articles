Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.
After the death of leader John Smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give Tony Blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the Granita restaurant in Islington.
A trip to Africa earlier this year, to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations, also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.
Profile: Gordon Brown  The ultimate prize of 10 Downing Street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, Gordon Brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.
He reached that milestone last June, when he overtook David Lloyd George, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915.
How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: "those who fail and those who get out in time.")
There are rumours he will be moved to the Foreign Office if Labour wins the general election.
But, for now, Mr Brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.

All the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in May, although Prime Minister Tony Blair has not confirmed any timing.
"We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party," he said.
Unveiling the slogan at the party's spring conference, he said there was no "glass ceiling" to its ambitions.
He told delegates that Labour had abused the public's trust and that the Tories had failed to oppose them.
In response, the Conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the "forgotten majority".

Labour chooses Manchester  The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.
The much trailed decision was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue.
It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event.
Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.

A decision on whether to allow Westminster to legislate on super-casinos is set to be made by the Scottish Parliament. Scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in Scotland. The new gambling bill going through Westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public, have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. But the Scottish National Party and the Tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in Scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.

The government has plans for up to eight Las Vegas style resorts in the UK, one of which is likely to be in Glasgow. A super-casino in Glasgow could be located at Ibrox or the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. The new gambling bill going through Westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public, have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes.

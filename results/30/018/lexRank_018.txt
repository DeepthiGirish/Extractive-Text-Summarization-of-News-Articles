Straw to attend Auschwitz service  Foreign Secretary Jack Straw will visit Auschwitz for the 60th anniversary of the former Nazi concentration camp's liberation, it has been announced.
Prince Edward will also join the UK delegation in Poland for National Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January.
Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz.
The Tories said they were glad Mr Straw had been "shamed" into going, having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official.

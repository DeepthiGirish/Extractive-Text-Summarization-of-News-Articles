Brown visits slum on Africa trip  Chancellor Gordon Brown has visited Kenya's biggest shantytown as he opened a week-long visit to Africa.
Mr Brown's trip is designed to highlight how the UK wants to make Africa's problems a priority of its chairmanship of the G8 this year.
He will see an HIV/Aids orphanage in Tanzania and a women's credit union in Mozambique before chairing a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town.
At slums in Narobi on Wednesday, he said education needs had to be tackled.

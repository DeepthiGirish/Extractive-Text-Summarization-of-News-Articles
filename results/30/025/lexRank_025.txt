UK 'needs true immigration data'  A former Home Office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor UK immigration.
Barbara Roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government.
She said this would counter "so-called independent" groups like Migration Watch, which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent.
Migration Watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures.

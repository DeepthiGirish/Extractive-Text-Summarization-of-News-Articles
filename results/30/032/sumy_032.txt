A bid to overturn the law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales has begun in the Court of Appeal.Richard Dodd, regional director of the Countryside Alliance, said he expected between 2,000 and 4,000 supporters in Tyneside to make their protest, with hunt horns and placards.Fathers 4 Justice, pensioners' rights activists and Stop the War campaigners were also expected to demonstrate during the three-day conference which starts on Friday.The High Court last month ruled the act was valid and the proposed hunting ban was lawful.Pro-hunt supporters formally launched their second legal challenge to the ban in London's High Court on Thursday.The Countryside Alliance has lodged papers seeking a judicial review on human rights grounds.

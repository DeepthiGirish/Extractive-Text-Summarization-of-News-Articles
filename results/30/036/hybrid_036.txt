On the Asian tsunami he said it had been "very heartening" to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons. At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.The general election would be a three-party struggle, as the Conservative party "fades away" as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said.

His party "instinctively" understood the "new liberal Britain" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said.

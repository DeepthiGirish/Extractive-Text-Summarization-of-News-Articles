She has won a number of arts prizes including the Wales Open in 1989 and the Mostyn Open in 1991.
The Arts Council of Wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government's umbrella.

Ms James, whose father was Welsh, was born in Melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre.
Culture Minister Alun Pugh said it would be "crass and ignorant" to liken a quango review to Hitler's Germany.

Ms James told BBC Radio Wales: "It's quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it's not like the health service and it's not like the railways.
"Free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society.
You need distance, you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way."

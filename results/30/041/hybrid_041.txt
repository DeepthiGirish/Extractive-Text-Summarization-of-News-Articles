Before he resigned the position of home secretary on Wednesday, David Blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race, policing and immigration. Named home secretary after the 2001 general election, Mr Blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. Mr Blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister Beverly Hughes. Avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary, who spurns a metropolitan elite and "airy fairy libertarians" and earlier in the year coined the phrase "liberati", as an amalgam of "glitterati" and "liberal". His relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box, in the Labour Party's National Executive, and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. He chaired the Labour Party nationally, and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s, shadowing health and education. He was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. In the Labour Party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague, a conciliator who avoids factions, and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. In 1999, his then guide dog Lucy threw up in the Chamber during the speech of his Tory opponent.

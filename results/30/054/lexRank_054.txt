Lib Dems 'to target stamp duty'  The Liberal Democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election, in a bid to court first-time house buyers.
The plan forms part of a wider Lib Dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.
Vince Cable, the party's Treasury spokesman, said raising the threshold to Â£150,000 would prevent over 400,000 home-buyers from paying the tax.
The Labour party said the Liberal Democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan.

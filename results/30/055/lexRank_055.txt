Head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school, who sexually abuse pupils or other people, who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour.
The Conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run-up to the next general election.

She told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost: "It is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom.
"But quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled.

The minister also confirmed she received "spiritual support" from the Catholic movement Opus Dei.
But she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs.

"We are working closely with the council and will do all we can to help rectify the problem.
"This is affecting several hundred properties, which have failed to receive ballot papers.
She said the commission was satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure all voters received ballot papers in time.
Royal Mail says it is investigating the situation, which has meant about 300 homes in County Durham are not receiving voting packs.
Officials at Darlington Council are now in a race against time to try and rectify the situation.

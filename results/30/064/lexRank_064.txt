Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea.
Mr Blair said having Turkey in the EU was of "importance to the future peace and prosperity of my country, Britain, and the wider world".
The internationally recognised southern part of Cyprus is an EU member, but Turkey, which occupies northern Cyprus, had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country, calling the issue a "red line".
Leaving a Brussels summit Mr Blair said "the fact Turkey is a Muslim country does not mean it should be barred".
"On the contrary, if it fulfils the same principles of human rights, then Muslim and Christian can work together."

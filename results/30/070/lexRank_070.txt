The Lib Dems also oppose the proposals, but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.
Home Secretary Charles Clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the Egyptian man, known only as C, certified as a terrorist suspect.
Controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the UK without trial or charge since December 2001 was freed from jail.
On Monday, the legal team for two Algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest.
The Liberal Democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure.
Home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It's a matter of principle for us that we can't have a situation where the Home Secretary is able to impose house detention now on UK nationals as well as foreign nationals."
Michael Howard said he would not back the Home Secretary's plans for "control orders" which include home detention.

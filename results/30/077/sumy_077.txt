Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.A shortened Finance Bill would have to be rushed through Parliament with all-party support to allow the Government to continue collecting revenue.The full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office.As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy.

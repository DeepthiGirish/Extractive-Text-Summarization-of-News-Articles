The proposed scheme would mean voters using individual "identifiers" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system. And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters. He said it might also help register students in halls of residences, where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. Currently, British voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running.

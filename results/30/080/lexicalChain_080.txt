The government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive, a report says. The National Audit Office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year. Some 26 million adults lack maths or English skill levels expected of school-leavers. Auditor General Sir John Bourn said: "Higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit England both socially and economically. The report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas, so courses can be set to meet local demand. Existing adult learners could use their "enthusiasm, commitment and local knowledge" to attract other people. The Department for Education and Skills could also use more "personalised learning" and work with voluntary groups, councils and employers. When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was "only the start of the journey". 2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14. The qualifications achieved by those taking part in the government's scheme range up to GCSE equivalents. Education minister Ivan Lewis said: "We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace.

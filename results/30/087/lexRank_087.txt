Anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin.
Refugee Council Chief Executive Maeve Sherlock called the plans "dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible".
Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans.
But he said it was "absolutely disgusting" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees.
"We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum," Mr Howard said.
There would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.
- Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for "national security" - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps.
As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs.
Some charities say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.

As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs.Tory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said."We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum," Mr Howard said.And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case.In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."The plans would help achieve a "substantial reduction" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure.Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough.He said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current "unfair and inhumane" system.Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.

Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing "cold calls".The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising."He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again.The spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.

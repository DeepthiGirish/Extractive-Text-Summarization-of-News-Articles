Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers.
"It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliament and special advisers?"
The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said.
Mr Howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next.
The plan forms part of the party's "smaller government bill", to be unveiled later this week.
And he said a referendum would be held in Wales to decide whether or not to scrap the Welsh Assembly.

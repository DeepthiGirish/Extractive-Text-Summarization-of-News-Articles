The Conservative Party would cut the number of MPs by about one-fifth if they were elected, Tory leader Michael Howard has said.Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers.The changes would all take place within five years of the Conservatives winning a general election, Mr Howard told the paper.The precise number of MPs to go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659.Mr Howard said the plan would also even out the "great unfairness" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England.The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was "consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom" if the assembly was scrapped.

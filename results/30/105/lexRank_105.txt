"If a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area," she added.
IHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused Ms Blears of "playing an Islamophobia card" in the run-up to a general election.
Muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws.
"It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community.
It was a reality that should be recognised, she said.
"She is demonising and alienating our community," he said.
The minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.
Statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were Muslim, he added Figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.

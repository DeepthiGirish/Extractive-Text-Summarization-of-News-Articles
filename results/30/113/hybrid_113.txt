Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was "out of control" during the "wild" 1960s.Lucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as "Precious" at school. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.Mr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: "I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead." He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a "set-up" but he then realised all the dates fitted. We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection." Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children.

Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was "out of control" during the "wild" 1960s. Lucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as "Precious" at school. Mr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: "I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: "The earth went from under my feet. " Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.

The Green Party is concerned thousands of residents may not be able to vote in Edinburgh's transport referendum. Edinburgh City Council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital.

Local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters, such as the transport referendum.

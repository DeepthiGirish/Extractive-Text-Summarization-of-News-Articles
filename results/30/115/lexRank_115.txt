These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including Labour backbencher Gwyneth Dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties.
He estimates that this would save the country Â£119m a year.
A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport Document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year.
New drink limit 'would cut toll'  More lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says.
The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs are due to vote on the government's Road Safety Bill.
The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit.
The research, carried out by transport expert professor Richard Allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared with 2003.
The findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking.

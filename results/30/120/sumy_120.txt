Prince Harry should personally make clear how sorry he is about wearing a Nazi uniform to a friend's fancy dress party, says Tory leader Michael Howard.That was a message repeated by Home Secretary Charles Clarke who said the matter should now be left to lie.But Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said Harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person.Former Labour MP Lord Janner, who is a high profile member of Britain's Jewish community, branded Harry's action's "stupid and evil".But former Buckingham Palace press spokesman Dicky Arbiter said the prince should make a personal, broadcast apology.Mr Clarke said he recognised people's concerns about the costume but argued: "He has apologised and I think we should leave the matter there."

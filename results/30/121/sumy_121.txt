Hospital waiting times for patients in Wales are to be cut, but not to the same extent as those in England.This current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside Wales.Dr Richard Lewis, Welsh secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA), welcomed the new targets "to make further and faster progress on waiting lists".On Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced Â£264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.Ms Hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting "unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year".She added the targets intended to ensure no-one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant.Rhodri Glyn Thomas, Plaid Cymru health spokesman said: "It's exactly the same target she set in 1999, with the qualification that it's dependent on a second offer.For the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Kirsty Williams called the new target "hugely unambitious".Conservative health spokesman Jonathan Morgan said: "We're spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof."The Audit Commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively, and that's quite a criticism."

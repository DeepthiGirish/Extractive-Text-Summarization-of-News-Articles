Some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels, Oxfam says in a report, Paying the Price. The call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the G8 of top industrialised nations. "The world's poorest children are paying for rich countries' policies in aid and debt with their lives. "2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure," the charity's director added. The report said: "For rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity. But 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable, the report says. "Environmental crises and natural disasters, disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. "New threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities. "Both the prime minister and Chancellor Gordon Brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty.

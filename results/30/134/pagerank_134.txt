We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again," hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said.Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them.He said police had "acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences".He said police would challenge the "one of two isolated hunts" which are threatening to break the law.He said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban, hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting."The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements.

Tony Blair has predicted the British Government will eventually give "hundreds of millions" of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami. He was speaking before the UK joins a three-minute silence at noon across the EU for the estimated 150,000 dead. Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel." The important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the Â£50m given by the government so far only "six or seven million" had been spent. So we will far and away more than match the generosity of the British people," he said. He also spoke on the telephone to US President George Bush, and the presidents of Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Chancellor Gordon Brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations. During his trip, Mr Straw will represent the G8 at the international conference called in Jakarta, Indonesia on Thursday. The British public has now pledged Â£76m in aid with emergency supplies from the British government starting to arrive in the region on three RAF flights in a joint operation with Scandinavian countries. Two ships - the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Diligence and frigate HMS Chatham - have arrived in the disaster area.

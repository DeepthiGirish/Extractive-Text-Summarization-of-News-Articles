The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK.Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded "deeply irresponsible" by the Liberal Democrats.Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to Â£680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency.Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back.Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK.And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.

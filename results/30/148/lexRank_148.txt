Mr Sukul said: "When (the officers) arrived there, in the middle of the night, they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six Asian men present.
The police officers left the warehouse, but were later ordered back to seize the documents.
"(When they went) back to make the seizure, every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope A and sealed.
Labour trio 'had vote-rig factory'  Three Labour councillors in Birmingham were caught operating a "vote-rigging factory", an Election Court has heard.
The case against Muhammad Afzal, Mohammed Islam and Mohammed Kazi is being brought by local Liberal Democrat supporters.
Witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office, which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off Birch Road East, the court was told.
The special Election Court, the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging, opened in Birmingham last month.
The votes were later counted towards that month's English local elections.

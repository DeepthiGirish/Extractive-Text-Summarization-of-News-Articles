Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: "There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting.
"If people do so and pretend they're not it's going to become very clear.
But anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts.
But Penny Little, who monitored the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, said she had witnessed "gratuitous, spiteful killing of foxes".
People had turned out "to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed "legally" as far as he was aware.
Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police.
The rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on Friday, and pretended they were not.

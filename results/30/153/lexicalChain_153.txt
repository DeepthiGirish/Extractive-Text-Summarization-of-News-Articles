New controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on Monday. Home Secretary Charles Clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: "We should cut the number or increase it depending on the country's needs. Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair. " Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis said the government had failed to remove 250,000 failed asylum seekers from the UK and limits on economic migrants had been a "shambles". Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said Labour was right to reject the Tories' idea of quotas on asylum.

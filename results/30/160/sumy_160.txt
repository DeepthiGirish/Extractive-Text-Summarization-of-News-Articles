A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws says the current system is giving Britain a bad name.Ian MacDonald QC quit when the government failed to recognise a House of Lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful.Under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial.The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday.But Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty, told Radio 4's Today programme that more lawyers may go."They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights.""Without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot, as Ian McDonald has said, on our legal landscape, something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law."

Kinnock to urge reform in Lords  Neil Kinnock has said his acceptance of a seat in the House of Lords will allow him to help "achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform."
On the BBC's Breakfast with Frost it was put to Mr Kinnock that he had once referred to Lords members as "brigands, muggers, bribers and gangsters".
But the outgoing European Commissioner said his comments - made some 26 years ago - needed to be put in context.

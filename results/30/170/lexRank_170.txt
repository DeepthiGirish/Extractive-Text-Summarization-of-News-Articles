Hospital suspends 'no Welsh' plan  An English hospital has suspended plans to stop treating Welsh patients who have waited more than three months.
Earlier, David Rose, Chief Executive of Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust, had said: "It is with real regret that we have taken this step.
The contract with the Powys health board was worth Â£7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients.
"But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate," said the assembly government.
Hereford County Hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations.
"In 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want Powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital.
GPs in Wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue.

Tories pledge free sports lessons  Children would be offered two hours' free sports training a week by a future Tory government, the party has said.
The extra coaching would be funded by the National Lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school.
The Club2School policy would provide up to Â£250m yearly for local sports clubs in the UK to deliver after-school sport.
Shadow home secretary David Davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities.

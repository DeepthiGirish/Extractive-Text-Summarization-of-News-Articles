Napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the European Convention on Human Rights, in which he sought Â£5,000.
Judge Lord Cullen, sitting with Lord Osborne and Lord Hamilton, ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard.
Scottish National Party Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill said that the slopping out case had been "a fiasco from start to finish".
On Thursday, the Court of Session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof.
Armed robber Robert Napier, 25, won Â£2,450 after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint, eczema, when slopping out at Barlinnie Prison.
Napier said that the practice, where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets, breached his human rights.
The executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates.

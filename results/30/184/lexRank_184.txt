Lord Goldsmith has denied being "leaned on" and says the words written were his.
Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.
"In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions," he said.
The government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.
"And this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister."
Mr Mates, who is a member of the Commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the Butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence, told the BBC on Friday: "That, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule."
In a book published this week, Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers, says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.
He refused to answer further questions on the issue, saying it had been dealt with "literally scores of times and the position has not changed".

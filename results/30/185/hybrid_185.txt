 Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former St Andrews United Reform Church.Taha Idris, director of the Swansea Bay Race Equality Council, said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public. According to the BNP's website, they have been posted to homes in the Castle ward. It is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque.Andy Richards, of Swansea UAF, said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the BNP." Swansea's Muslim community bought the former church, just across the road from the existing mosque on St Helen's Road, in the late 1990s. Mr Idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building. "It is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner.

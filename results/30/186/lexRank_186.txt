I think that's a matter of great regret."
The row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britain's first gay MP.
"If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong," he told reporters.
Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.
"Let's just apologise and move on - that's the sensible thing."
Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstone's remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use.

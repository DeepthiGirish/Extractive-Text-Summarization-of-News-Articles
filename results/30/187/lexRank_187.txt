Jowell confirms casino climbdown  Tessa Jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the UK to 24, in a move branded a "humiliating retreat" by the Tories.
But Conservative shadow culture secretary John Whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a "shambles".
It puts an end to plans for up to 40 super casinos, originally outlined in the government's Gambling Bill.
Instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category - small, medium and large.
"This announcement is a further humiliating retreat by the government.
"Instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill, to liberalise the rules governing gambling, the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present."

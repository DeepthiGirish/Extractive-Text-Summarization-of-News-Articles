The files are believed to contain detailed security arrangements for Gen Pervez Musharraf's visit this week, including police codes.
The papers are believed to have been found by a member of the public in a street in Mayfair and given to the Mirror newspaper.
He is due to visit the Pakistani community in Manchester on Tuesday afternoon.
A spokesman said President Musharraf's safety had not been compromised, as the papers had been handed in promptly.

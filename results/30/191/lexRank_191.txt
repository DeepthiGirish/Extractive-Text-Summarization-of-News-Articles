Short attacks US over tsunami aid  Former Cabinet minister Clare Short has criticised the US-led tsunami aid coalition, saying the UN should be leading efforts.
President Bush has announced that an alliance of the US, India, Australia and Japan will co-ordinate a humanitarian drive.
But Ms Short said the effect of the parallel coalition would be to undermine the UN.
She said only the UN had the "moral authority" to lead the relief work.

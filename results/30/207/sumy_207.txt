Reports that Tony Blair is planning a snap general election for February 2005 have been described as "idle speculation" by Downing Street.The papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a "Baghdad bounce" following successful Iraq elections in January.But that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to "cut and run" after less then four years of a parliamentary term.A Labour Party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for Mr Blair, but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in February.

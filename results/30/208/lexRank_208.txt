The deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei.
"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment," he said.
Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province.
Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.

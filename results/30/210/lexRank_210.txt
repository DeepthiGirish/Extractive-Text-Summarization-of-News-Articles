The strike also affected the Welsh assembly building in Cardiff Bay, where only pass-holders were allowed in.
"People like pensioners need a face-to-face service not an impersonal service on the phone which is what they want to impose."
Across Wales, pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including Cardiff, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Wrexham.

The action follows Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in July that 104,000 jobs would be cut, with around 6,000 of those expected in Wales.
The worst-affected area in Wales will be the Department of Work and Pensions where 2,000 jobs are threatened.

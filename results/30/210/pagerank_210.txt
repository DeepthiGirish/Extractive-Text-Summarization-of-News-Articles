A range of services in Wales were affected as civil servants in Wales joined the UK-wide strike.PCS Union spokesman Jeff Evans said: "In Wales the civil service is major employer, there are more civil servants employed in Wales proportionately than in any other part of the country.Thousands of civil servants were on strike across Wales on Friday in protest at planned job cuts.The Welsh Assembly Government said: "This is a strike about national civil service issues.Across Wales, pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including Cardiff, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Wrexham."Our protest is about defending jobs and also local services across the country.The action follows Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in July that 104,000 jobs would be cut, with around 6,000 of those expected in Wales.Pickets were in place across Wales, with protests around the country.

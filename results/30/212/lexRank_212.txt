Tory expert denies defeatism  The Conservatives' campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned Michael Howard the party could not win the next general election.
The Times on Monday said Australian Lynton Crosby told the party leader to focus on trying to increase the Tories' Commons presence by 25 to 30 seats.
But Mr Crosby said in a statement: "I have never had any such conversation... and I do not hold that view."

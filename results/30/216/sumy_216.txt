Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge.Mr Solana's comments come the day after Sir Ian Blair, the newly-appointed Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance.But Mr Clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after Law Lords ruled it illegal.He has opted for a system of "control orders" whereby suspects, both British and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance.While accepting that people "have to be prepared" for a possible terrorist attack, Mr Solana said he had "qualms" about the home secretary's new plans.

Ms Jamieson praised the police for their action and said: "The police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them.
Ms Jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers.
Praising Celtic and Rangers for their efforts, she said: "I don't think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs.
"Both Rangers and Celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce, for example, an educational pack for young people."

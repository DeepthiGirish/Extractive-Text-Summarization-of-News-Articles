Anyone planning to move to the UK will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said.Mr Clarke, who will unveil his plans on Monday, said economic migration helped the UK but "needed proper policing".The Lib Dems say they will look at his plans, but Tory Liam Fox said his party offered a "clear choice" on the issue.The Conservative Party Co-Chairman said the British electorate had a choice between a Labour government that had "done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit" on immigration and a Tory one that would impose quotas.Speaking on BBC One's Breakfast with Frost, he said "economic migrants are of great value to this country", but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a "burden on society".Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, called on Mr Clarke to denounce the suggestion Britain's hospitality was being tested by immigration."Ditto the teachers, from South Africa, Australia, Jamaica, who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools."

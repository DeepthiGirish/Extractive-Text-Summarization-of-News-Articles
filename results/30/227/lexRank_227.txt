Mr Clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail.
He told BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme that Mr Clarke had a "real opportunity" on Monday following the departure of Mr Blunkett.
Mr Howard last week said his front bench team had reached a "collective view" to back ID cards after holding a "good discussion", but admitted it was "not an easy issue".
Up to 30 Labour MPs could oppose the scheme during a Commons debate.
Mr Clarke, who took on the post on Thursday after David Blunkett quit, has rejected calls to "pause" on the bill.
The Liberal Democrats oppose the plans.
Mr Clarke, writing in The Times, accused some critics of "liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears" by claiming ID cards would erode civil liberties.

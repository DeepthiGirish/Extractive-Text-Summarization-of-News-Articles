The leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use "reasonable force".
But knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of "excessive and gratuitous" force.

The law also protects those who use "something to hand" as a weapon.
The guidance, relating to England and Wales, follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law.
Doing what you "honestly and instinctively" believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said.
And the law protects those who use "something to hand" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).

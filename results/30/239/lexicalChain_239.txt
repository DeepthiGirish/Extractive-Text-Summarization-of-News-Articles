The Police Federation has said it strongly opposes giving Community Support Officers (CSOs) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes. The powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in England and Wales on Thursday. Police Federation chairman Jan Berry said civilian officers should act as "eyes and ears" for the police. But Home Office minister Hazel Blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers "just that little bit of edge". Shadow home secretary David Davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that CSOs were having no discernible effect on crime figures. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the research is inconclusive. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill proposes extra powers to search suspects, enforce licensing offences, direct traffic and deter begging.

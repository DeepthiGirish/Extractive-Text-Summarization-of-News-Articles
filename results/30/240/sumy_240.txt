A group of MPs and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport.It followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport, such as that done using the internet and mobile phones, has led to more cheating.They include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years.Lord Condon, head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit, who originally made the call for longer prison sentences, said the two-year penalty was "derisory"."You could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports.

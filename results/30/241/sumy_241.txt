Authorities will decide final figures on Thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation, which is currently 1.6%.Scottish Finance Minister, Tom McCabe MSP, said: "Last week in parliament I announced an additional Â£419m for core expenditure to local government in Scotland."That's a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so I think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint."Mr McCabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years."However, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services," a Cosla spokesman said.Cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services.They say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending.The Tory finance spokesman, Brian Monteith MSP, said: "Its a form of disguise... yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs.Linda Knox, Director of the Scottish Local Authority Management Centre at Strathclyde University, said: "With this current settlement the increase is slowing.On the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1% in real terms."

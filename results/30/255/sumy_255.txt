Gordon Brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed Mr Blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election.The chancellor would not comment on the reports, but insisted he would not be "diverted or distracted" from tackling the challenges faced by the country.Mr Blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for Gordon Brown as old news.In a separate interview with BBC political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Brown said: "It's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government.Mr Brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on Saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do.He then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.He added: "Lots of ministers believe Tony Blair will attempt to move Gordon Brown out of the Treasury after the election.Senior MPs are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of Labour backbenchers on Monday.Health Secretary John Reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging Labour's re-election chances and would not be easily forgiven.Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of"squabbling like schoolboys".

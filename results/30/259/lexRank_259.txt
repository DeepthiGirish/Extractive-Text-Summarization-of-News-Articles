'Poll Idols' face first hurdles  Vote For Me - ITV1's Pop Idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week.
Opinion was more divided over Rodney Hylton-Potts, a 59-year-old convicted fraudster.
Mr Bell, who will be offering his advice to the contestants on Wednesday, argues that Westminster has its share of "odd balls" and the show will engage ordinary voters.
The contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos.
The winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election, which is expected in the spring.
"Any of them would make competent MPs," former independent MP Martin Bell insisted on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"If it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that," he said.
But Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's former press secretary, took a less charitable view, accusing the programme of "corrupting politics".
He said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters "with that bunch of nutters".
To give Sir Bernard his dues, Monday evening's opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists.
Among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star, who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels.

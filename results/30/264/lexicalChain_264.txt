The prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto. There was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with Chancellor Gordon Brown. There was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges, although the prime minister talked about a "New Labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society". His was more a speech designed to remind people, and some in his own party, precisely what New Labour stood for, and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach. To that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle England voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it, possibly through some gritted teeth, in 2001, and to more traditional lower income old Labour supporters. "Every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship. "The highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions". Under what is to be the general election slogan "Britain is working", the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour.

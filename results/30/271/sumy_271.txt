Tory leader Michael Howard says his party can save £35bn in government spending by tackling waste.The money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes."Let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did", he told BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost programme.The bulk of the £35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said."Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes," Mr Howard insisted.Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: "People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of £35bn worth of savings.A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century.Labour will hold key marginal constituencies, winning a majority of 160, the Populus survey suggests.And the Liberal Democrats will take three key seats from the Conservatives, leaving the Tories with just 163 MPs, two less than they returned atLabour's 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906.

The memory driving Brown's mission  The memory Gordon Brown says keeps returning to him - the one that he says is burnt into him - is that of a 12 year-old girl, whose parents died of Aids, and who is HIV positive herself.
Mr Brown seems haunted by her eyes, desolate of all hope.
And then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism: an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of Kenya's largest slum, advancing with crowded menace, flicking their hips in a manner almost as disturbing, before the finale of a clenched fist salute and shout of "free education - free education for all".
Mr Brown's message generally, that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered.
But he is such a pivotal figure in British politics, it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this.
His answer, in part, is because of the missionaries that used to come to his father's church.

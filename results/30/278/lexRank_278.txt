What really divides the parties  So what is the gap between Labour and the Tories nowadays?
One Starbucks, one Rymans and one small Greek cafe as it happens.
Both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters, with Labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the Tories' new headquarters in Victoria Street, just down the road from the Commons.
That should make things a little easier if and when the crack-of-dawn election press conferences kick off.
Unlike 2001, there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside, or to buy scooters, to get themselves between the tightly-timetabled events.

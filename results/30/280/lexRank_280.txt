Blair sees greater Bush consensus  George W Bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as US President, Tony Blair has said.
The prime minister said Mr Bush had learned military force was not the only way to fight terrorism.
He understood that "the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights", Mr Blair told the Guardian newspaper.
Mr Bush was sworn in at a ceremony in Washington DC on Thursday.
Echoing the new US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the prime minister said there has been a clear evolution of US policy since the war in Afghanistan in 2001.

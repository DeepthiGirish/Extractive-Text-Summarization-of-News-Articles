George W Bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as US President, Tony Blair has said.He understood that "the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights", Mr Blair told the Guardian newspaper.The president understood that while military and security measures were important, there also needed to be a multilateral approach to solving the world's problems.Turning to critics' fears that the US was poised for further military action, Mr Blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against Iran.Following claims that US forces had worked inside Iran to identify potential targets, Mr Blair was asked if the SAS had also been in the country.

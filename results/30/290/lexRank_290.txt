We were threatened by the nuclear holocaust, the nuclear wind, the nuclear winter.
Wake up!
What is to stop false denunciations?
We, as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro US propaganda, which of course also means we'll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods.
A week after my first birthday, the threat had become reality.
On top of that, they claim to be following Islam in its true form!
Our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace, because invading foreign nations, imprisoning the innocent and 'hunting' in the 'shadows' cannot destroy an evil of the mind, and hatred within the heart.

He uses the same arguments that were current before the WWII, the Wars to "liberate" Iraq, Afghanistan with Syria and Iran to come.
Who can have faith in the honesty, integrity, and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years?
We built shelters that would have sheltered nothing.
It should be of great concern to everyone.
We are sleep-walking into this.

They have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions.
Mr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise.

We spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals.
The problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no.
This person is self-reflective and constantly tries to better her/his actions by being good to others.
I do not believe the government's plans are justified.
I believe what this government is doing, is, at the very least, highly questionable and at worst, sinister.
Like New Labour, he believed he was promoting the people's best interests.
Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupants of 10 Downing Street, there was no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin as there has been on Afghanistan and Iraq.
I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.

Civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible.
Some fought it; some marched futilely against it.
There are extremely worrying parallels between Britain now and Germany during the 30's.
I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.
We can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms.
Remember there were no WMD in Iraq.
Some pretended it was not there.
An interesting article - its good to see widening participation in the debate - but I suggest we move one step further.

Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little Austrian.'
The IRA wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement.
We have to be politically-correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions.
We have a Prime Minister who spends too much time meddling in US politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of British Citizens at home or abroad.
Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.
Thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even IRA bombs could not force us to become a tyranny.

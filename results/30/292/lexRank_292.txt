The documentary showed Mr Nattrass, apparently talking about the EU, telling the meeting: "The Germans are the big losers here but they don't care because to them the project is worthwhile.
He did not defend other groups' religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views - just as Mr Kilroy-Silk had a right to criticise Arab states.
Mike Nattrass, UKIP's deputy leader, made the comments to an audience at a meeting during last September's Hartlepool by-election campaign.
The meeting was shown in a BBC 3 film on ex-UKIP MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk.
But challenged on the remark, he denied accusing Germany of using the EU as cover for a "4th German Reich".
"So it's cheaper for them to do it this way than roll the tanks in."
He says he was not "German-bashing" but saying peace was the EU's founding aim.
It's the truth."
Asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions, Mr Kilroy-Silk said: "There was one thing I said that I shouldn't have said at the time.
On Tuesday, he told the BBC News website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with MEPs of different nationalities in the European Parliament.

Tories leave door open for Archer  The Conservative Party would deal "sympathetically" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.
Dr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for "vindictiveness" in politics.
Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice.
The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.
A jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.

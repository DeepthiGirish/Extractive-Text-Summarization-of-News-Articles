Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: "This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.
Despite giving their backing to ID cards, the Conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.
And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected.
The party has been "agnostic" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the Tory source said.
The shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week's Commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory ID.
The bill, which ministers claim will tackle crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, is expected to be opposed by the Liberal Democrats.

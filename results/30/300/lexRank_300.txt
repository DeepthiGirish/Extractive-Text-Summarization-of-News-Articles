Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme.
"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken."
He said: "This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards."
The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.
Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could "help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives".
The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a "collective view" after holding a "good discussion", but admitted it was "not an easy issue".
The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.
Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo.
He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would "set out the position very clearly" when he stands up to debate the matter next week.

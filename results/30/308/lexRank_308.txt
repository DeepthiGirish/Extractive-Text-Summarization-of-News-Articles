Tory 'stalking horse' Meyer dies  Sir Anthony Meyer, the Tory backbencher who challenged Margaret Thatcher for the party leadership in 1989, has died.
He was 84, had been suffering from cancer for many months, and died at his London home.
That failed "stalking horse" leadership challenge made it easier for Michael Heseltine to mount his own bid.

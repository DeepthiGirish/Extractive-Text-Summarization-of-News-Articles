A group of MPs has tried to raise the pressure on Tony Blair over reform to the House of Lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. But the all-party group, including Tories Ken Clarke and Sir George Young, Labour's Robin Cook and Tony Wright and Liberal Democrat Paul Tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a "large majority". And they list former Conservative leader William Hague and former Labour leader Neil Kinnock as supporters of the plans. The group says the British public and a clear majority of MPs support replacing the Lords with a largely-elected second chamber. Their plan would see the House of Lords being renamed the Second Chamber of Parliament, and its members would be known as MSCPs. He added: "Over the last year I have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice. "The group believes pressure is growing for change and the government's current position is unsustainable. And Mr Tyler said the prime minister's view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the Lords was flawed. The Elect the Lords Campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate.

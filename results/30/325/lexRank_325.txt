Damian Hockney, now Veritas deputy leader, and Peter Hulme-Cross were elected in 2004 on the list system.
Mr Hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the GLA as it did for other electoral list systems.
"The Greater London Act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list, their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party."
Veritas was formed by Mr Kilroy-Silk earlier this month after he quit UKIP following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.

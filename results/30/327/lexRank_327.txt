He has dealt with this time and time and time again," Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street.
The government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said.
The claims about Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan's involvement were made in a book published this week by Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers.
He refused to answer further questions on the issue.
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.
Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said Lord Goldsmith's statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues.
"The attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did," he said.
Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.
"No other minister or official was involved in any way."
He suggested the claim that Lord Falconer and Lady Morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the Butler Inquiry into pre-war intelligence.

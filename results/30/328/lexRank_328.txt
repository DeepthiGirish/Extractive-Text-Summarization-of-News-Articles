In the House of Lords, the attorney general faced a call by former Tory lord chancellor Lord Mackay to now publish the "full text" of the advice - the suggestion was rejected.
Another peer meanwhile, Lord Skidelsky, said not to publish the full legal opinion would "strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption, in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction".
The text was released on the eve of a crucial Commons vote in which MPs backed the invasion of Iraq.
A book published by Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.
Many Labour MPs have since indicated that the attorney general's answer played a pivotal role in their willingness to back the conflict.
He refused to answer further questions on the issue.
"The answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government."
Goldsmith: 'I was not leant on'  The attorney general has again denied being "leant on" by Downing Street to make the legal case for invading Iraq.

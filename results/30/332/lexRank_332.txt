Mr Milburn said he appreciated people's concerns, but insisted that "what they were was anti-Tory" and "not in any way, shape or form anti-Semitic".
A row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict Michael Howard, who is Jewish, as Fagin, and as a flying pig, amid claims they were anti-Semitic.
The posters were labelled a "big misjudgement" by the Conservatives who said Labour's "first shot in the election has badly backfired".
He was responding to Tory spokesman Julian Lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party.
The Fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off Labour's website on Monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5.
Labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.

The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to "change the face" of UK politics.
UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.
UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.
UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been "straightforward" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.
Kilroy names election seat target  Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.
Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority.
She says she will fight on her record "as a hard-working constituency MP".

Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was "in part" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy.
Mr Blair said he was taking "nothing for granted" ahead of the vote - warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.
But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May.
The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.
Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking.

Mr Brown earmarked Â£1bn to help keep down council tax rises next year.
Lib Dem spokesman Vince Cable said the public did not know who to believe and the National Audit Office should judge.
He suggested keeping British troops in Iraq could cost another Â£1bn with the government also planning to spend at least Â£3bn for identity cards.
He urged the government to scrap the "grossly unfair" tax completely.
And one-and-a-half million hard working families were paying 60% marginal tax rates.
Mr Brown confirmed he was setting aside another Â£520m for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Instead, what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the "complete mess" produced by Mr Brown's endless tinkering.
City experts say there is a Â£10bn "black hole" in the public finances, a claim denied by the chancellor.
Mr Cable also accused the chancellor of ducking tough choices.

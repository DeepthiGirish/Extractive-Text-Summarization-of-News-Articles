It is expected this would increase the number of Chinese tourists by 40,000 per year, providing $120m in revenue.
"The result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from European Union member states to China, either in quantitative or qualitative terms," Mr Straw said.
Washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in China have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo.
But Mr Straw insisted the EU's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.
China has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven, and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons.
He said Mr Straw was "naive beyond belief" if he accepted China's claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons.
Mr Straw, visiting Beijing, noted arms embargoes applied to China, Burma and Zimbabwe but not to North Korea, which he said had a terrible rights record.

Mr Boateng, 53, is to become the UK's high commissioner to South Africa."Mr Blair's appointment of Paul Boateng is the latest example of a worrying trend of failed Tony's cronies being appointed to senior diplomatic posts," he said.Mr Boateng said: "I am honoured to be asked to take on this role, especially as it comes at such an integral time for our relationship with South Africa and the African continent.Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said that, if in government, he would refuse to approve either Mr Boateng's appointment or that of ex-Cabinet minister Helen Liddell as high commissioner to Australia.Prime Minister Tony Blair said: "Paul has been both a valued colleague and a trusted friend for many years."I congratulate Paul on his new appointment.

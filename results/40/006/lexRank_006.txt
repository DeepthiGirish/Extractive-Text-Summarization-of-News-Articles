'Errors' doomed first Dome sale  The initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government's finance watchdog says.
The NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome.
He said: "This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco.
The report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended.
The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers Â£28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed.
Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck.

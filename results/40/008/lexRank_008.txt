Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.
Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings.

Women MPs reveal sexist taunts  Women MPs endure "shocking" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.
Male MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered "melons" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told.
Labour's Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary.
Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study "Whose Secretary are You, minister".
But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities.
Barbara Follet, one of the so-called "Blair Babes" elected in 1997, told researchers: "I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke."

Crucial decision on super-casinos  A decision on whether to allow Westminster to legislate on super-casinos is set to be made by the Scottish Parliament.
The government has plans for up to eight Las Vegas style resorts in the UK, one of which is likely to be in Glasgow.
Scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in Scotland.
But opposition parties say that will not happen in practice.

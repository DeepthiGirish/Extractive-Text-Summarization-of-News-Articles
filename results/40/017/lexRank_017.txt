Tsunami debt deal to be announced  Chancellor Gordon Brown has said he hopes to announce a deal to suspend debt interest repayments by tsunami-hit nations later on Friday.
The agreement by the G8 group of wealthy nations would save affected countries Â£3bn pounds a year, he said.
The deal is thought to have been hammered out on Thursday night after Japan, one of the biggest creditor nations, finally signed up to it.
Mr Brown first proposed the idea earlier this week.

The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.
His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications.
He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week.
Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay.
But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday.
"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response," said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.
"We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system," he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement.
"It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak."
The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to "compromise".
The QCA said the potential "step-change in participation and attainment" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma.

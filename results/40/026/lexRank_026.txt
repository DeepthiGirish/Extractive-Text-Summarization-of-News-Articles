Blair sets date for Africa report  The Commission for Africa's report will be released on 11 March - Comic Relief day, Tony Blair has said.
July's G8 summit in Gleneagles in Perthshire - chaired by the prime minister - will use the report as the basis for talks on Africa.
The announcement followed the final meeting of the commission - which includes singer Bob Geldof - in London.
As well as more aid, fairer trade and less debt, the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in Africa.
Mr Blair told a news conference: "It will be a report that's brutally frank about the reality, but I hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there.

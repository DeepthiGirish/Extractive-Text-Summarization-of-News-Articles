It is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day.
Parenting contracts, penalty notices and "fast track" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem.
Previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics.
Those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically.
Labour targets 'hardcore truants'  A fresh crackdown on persistent truants in England has been launched by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly.
Serial truants make up one in 13 pupils.
Tories say Labour's previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school.
Such absences are often due to family holidays.

On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using "grossly disproportionate" force could be prosecuted.
The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law.
The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr Clarke.
Tories attack burglar 'U-turns'  Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Tony Blair of performing U-turns over rules on using force against burglars.
The government has ruled out amending the present law, which allows "reasonable force" in self defence.
Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: "It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars."
He told MPs: "If we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law."

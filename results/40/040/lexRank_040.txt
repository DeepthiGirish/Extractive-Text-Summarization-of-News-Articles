The House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.
He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court.
In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: "I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.
"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation.
The foreign secretary said the right to life was the "most important liberty" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism.
The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism.
But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released.
He said the Law Lords' ruling was an "embarrassment" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.
"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords."

"To maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme, the government announced in its Green Paper on pensions that pension age would rise from 60 to 65."
Mr Prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government.
Pensions officer Paul Woolstenholmes said: "The pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from MPs and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country."
In a statement on Sunday, the Cabinet Office said it was reviewing the Civil Service Pension Scheme, and hoped to announce proposals soon.
"This is a position that Unison cannot accept and will oppose.
It is thought the proposed overhaul, due on Thursday, could mean pensions could be based on a "career average" salary.
Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal.
Ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next May.
"Public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable.
People are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive.

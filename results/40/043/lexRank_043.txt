Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a "decisive blow" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out.
Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55.
A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study.
Parties warned over 'grey vote'  Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.
Mr Lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.

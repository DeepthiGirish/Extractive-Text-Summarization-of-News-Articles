Tory leader 'cleared' over work  Scottish Conservative Party leader David McLetchie claims he has been cleared over a potential conflict of interest.
The Edinburgh MSP earns up to Â£30,000 a year from the law firm Tods Murray, where he is a partner.
Mr McLetchie said he has taken advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needs to declare.
He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.
As an MSP, Mr McLetchie signed a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport.
It then emerged Tods Murray has a client which opposes the development.

Anglers 'could face prosecution'  Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.
Sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said.
The MPs said they were "concerned" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare.
They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, MPs said.
They called for a "cast-iron guarantee" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing.
The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect "kept animals" and "companion" animals by setting up a "duty of care".
In addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible.
The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing "mutilation" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal's best interest.
The environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals.

This would "reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety", they said.
The court system should only be used as a last resort, where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with.
MPs criticise child access system  Divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system, MPs have said.
The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access.
Courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, MPs said.
But they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.
Currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount.

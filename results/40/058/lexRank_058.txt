He said "it is more likely than not" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July.
"If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now."
The 15-year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of China's crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square.
Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained.
But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.
In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet.
The EU's move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a "product of the Cold War".
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted.

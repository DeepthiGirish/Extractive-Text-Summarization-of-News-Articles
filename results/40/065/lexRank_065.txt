An identical letter has been sent to Feroz Abbasi, the men's solicitor says.
Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture.
The Liberal Democrats have promised to raise the issue in Parliament.
Mr Mubanga, 29, from north London, was originally detained in Zambia.
He said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the Royal Prerogative.
The government is implementing the rarely used Royal Prerogative in order to withdraw the men's passports.
A letter sent to Martin Mubanga said his British passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the US.
This suggested he was likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if he left Britain, it said.

The men were arrested in September after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted.
Speaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder.
In November, the use of the Parliament Act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales.
However, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt.
The men's solicitor Matthew Knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.
"We are not prosecuted for that.
They will appear at Bow Street Magistrates' Court on 21 December, a police spokesman said.
"There is no offence of trespassing in the House of Commons - it is not a criminal offence," he said.
"If Parliament wanted to make entering the House of Commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can't do so retrospectively.
Those charged included Otis Ferry, the 22-year-old son of rock star Bryan Ferry and Luke Tomlinson, 27, a close friend of princes William and Harry.

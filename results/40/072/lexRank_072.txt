Lord Strathclyde, Tory leader in the Lords, said ministers should expect it to be "substantially re-written".
The Bill proposes "control orders", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use.
Mr Clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the Lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians.

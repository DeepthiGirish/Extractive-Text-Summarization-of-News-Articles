Brown names 16 March for Budget  Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.
The Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister's question time.
The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions.
It is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election, widely expected on 5 May.

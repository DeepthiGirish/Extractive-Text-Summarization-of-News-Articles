In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing "the difficult issue" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children.

At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers.
Those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other Albanian authorities.
Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.

Job cuts 'false economy'  - TUC  Plans to shed 71,000 civil service jobs will prove to be a "false economy" that could hamper public sector reforms, according to a TUC report.
Public and Commercial Services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 November.
The TUC said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the Â£22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms.
General secretary Brendan Barber warned the "costs could easily outweigh the benefits".
"The government's big boost to public spending is now showing results," said Mr Barber.
"Public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy.

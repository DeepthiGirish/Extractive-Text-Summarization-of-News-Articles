UK's 'useless' quangos under fire  The UK has 529 quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers' cash - many of which are useless or duplicate each other's efforts, a report claims.
Essential Guide to British Quangos 2005 author Dan Lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since Labour won power in 1997.
He urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department.
Tories and Lib Dems welcomed the report and called for a "slimming down".

"A Conservative government will axe 162 quangos, as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government."

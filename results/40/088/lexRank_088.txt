The spokesman said there was "no yes or no" answer and the area was "pretty grey".
But that did not happen for "voter identification" calls.
We would not do things that are not allowed in the law."
She said: "We do apply TPS but in line with the law.
Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.
But the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person.
Political parties are aware of the regulations.
"When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not," he said.
"So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service."
But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS.
A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising.
Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: "The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal."

The government gives Â£200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60, or Â£300 where people are over 80.
The vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes.
Vouchers 'to cut winter deaths'  Pensioners are being promised energy savings by the Liberal Democrats, as snow and cold temperatures continue.
The party says the plans could save the average pensioner Â£100 every year and cut winter deaths.

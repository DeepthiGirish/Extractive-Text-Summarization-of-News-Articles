A Highland councillor who was at the event has also defended Mr McConnell.
But an executive spokeswoman insisted Mr McConnell had made the remark with adults, not youngsters, in mind.
"The first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately."
When one pupil asked Mr McConnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking, began his response with the quip: "I'm sure there's no under-age drinking in the Highlands."
"Far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly.
SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said: "This is an incredible gaffe by Jack McConnell.
The first minister's comments came in a question and answer session at Glenurquhart High School in Inverness, attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools.
He said: "I hope I'm not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people's health and their ability to control what's happening round about them."
Mr McConnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking.

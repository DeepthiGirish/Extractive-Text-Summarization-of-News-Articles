"Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity."
The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.
Payment levels vary from area to area, with some carers getting just Â£50 a week for clothes, food and other costs.
Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers' allowances would be as fair as possible.
However local authorities, which set and pay the allowances, are concerned about how the extra cash will be found.
About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.
Ms Hodge said: "Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society.

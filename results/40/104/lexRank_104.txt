Royal couple watch nation's mood  Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nation's reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.
Mrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle.
A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple's decision to marry.
But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king.
Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.
The poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince William, 22, on her death or abdication.
On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement.
Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: "I'm just coming down to earth."
She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters.

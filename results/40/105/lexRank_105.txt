IHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused Ms Blears of "playing an Islamophobia card" in the run-up to a general election.
Muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws.
"It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community.
It was a reality that should be recognised, she said.
"She is demonising and alienating our community," he said.
The minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.
Statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were Muslim, he added Figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.
Separate figures on police searches in England and Wales carried out under the Terrorism Act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted.
Muslim police stops 'more likely'  UK Muslims should accept that people of Islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police, a Home Office minister has said.

Mr Brown's insistence he was not "gloating" was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson.
Inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow, Mr Brown forecast.
Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are Â£35bn - Â£2.5bn less than the Â£37.5bn predicted in March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics.
Brown shrugs off economy fears  Gordon Brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a Â£1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.
He also pledged an extra Â£105m for security and counter-terrorism.
In an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met.
The chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK "industrial history" but denied he was "gloating".
But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr Brown "Sir Wastealot".
Mr Letwin told MPs: "The tide is going out on the chancellor's credibility.
He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer's money."
Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of ducking tough choices.
He said: "Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency.
"There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt.

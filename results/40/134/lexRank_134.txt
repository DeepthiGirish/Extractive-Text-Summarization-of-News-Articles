"You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one," he said.
Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them.
The Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend.
We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again," hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said.
Ban on hunting comes into force  Fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.
The law faces a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunts will be out in force.
He said police would challenge the "one of two isolated hunts" which are threatening to break the law.
But Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations.

Mr Brown, who was not at the Downing Street meeting, says he has been in "intensive talks" with other G8 finance ministers.
International Development Secretary Hilary Benn will also visit Aceh in Indonesia, as well as Sri Lanka.
He was speaking before the UK joins a three-minute silence at noon across the EU for the estimated 150,000 dead.
The prime minister took personal charge of the UK's response on Tuesday, chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since Boxing Day.
Blair says UK tsunami aid to soar  Tony Blair has predicted the British Government will eventually give "hundreds of millions" of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.
Mr Blair insisted he had been "intimately involved" in "all decisions at all times" despite being abroad.
The Foreign Office says 41 Britons are now confirmed to have died in the Tsunami which struck south Asia on Boxing Day, with 158 others missing.
Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel.
"I think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives."
The important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the Â£50m given by the government so far only "six or seven million" had been spent.
It would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in.
"My estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds.

EU fraud clampdown urged  EU member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in EU funds on a consistent basis, the UK's public spending watchdog has said.
A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO's assessment of fraud reporting.
The National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud.
It also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the European Court of Auditors had qualified the EU accounts.
The NAO urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud.
It said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent.
"As the court has now qualified its opinion on the Community accounts for a decade, it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of EU revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of EU resources."

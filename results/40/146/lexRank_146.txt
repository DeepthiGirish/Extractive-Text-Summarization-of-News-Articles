Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back.
But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats.
The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme.
In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a "sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries".
And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.
'Nuclear dumpsite' plan attacked  Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded "deeply irresponsible" by the Liberal Democrats.
But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a "nuclear dumpsite".
At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums.

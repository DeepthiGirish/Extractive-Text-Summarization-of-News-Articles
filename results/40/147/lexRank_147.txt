London's Evening Standard quoted Mr Clarke telling Labour activists at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny.
The prime minister told MPs: "The abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an automatic right to settle], the numbers will probably fall."
He told BBC Radio: "If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."
Mr Clarke dismissed the latest Tory attack.
Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said the comments were at odds with Tony Blair's prediction of a net cut in immigration.
But Mr Clarke accused him of trying to score "cheap political points" by muddling immigration with asylum.
"That's not only a moral duty and a legal duty, but something which is part of the essence of this country," he said.
"We want more migration, more people come to study and to work.
"We want more people coming to look for refuge."
Mr Blair's was asked last Wednesday if the government's new immigration plans, including a point system for economic migrants, would reduce net migration.

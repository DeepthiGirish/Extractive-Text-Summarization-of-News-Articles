Galloway plea for hostage release  Ex-Labour MP George Galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker Margaret Hassan, kidnapped in Iraq.
Mrs Hassan, 59, who led Care International operations in Iraq, was abducted in Baghdad on 19 October.
Mr Galloway was expelled from the Labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on Iraq.
He denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the Al-Jazeera Arabic television channel.
Speaking in London on Saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party, the Respect Coalition, he said: "I have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations.

The men have been allowed to meet their lawyers.
Louise Christian said that after being "tortured and abused" at Guantanamo Bay, the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate.
Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Feroz Abbasi and Richard Belmar were held for three years, accused of al-Qaeda links.
Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them.
Police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the UK.
But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens said evidence obtained by MI5 while the four were in Cuba was "absolutely" inadmissible in UK courts.
In an interview with the Independent, Sir John said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the UK.
He told the newspaper: "If an admission is made, it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence.
"The options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged.
If not they will be released as soon as possible."

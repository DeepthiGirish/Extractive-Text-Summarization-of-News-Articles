The government's new five-year plan is designed to show how Labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election, expected to be held in May.
Instead, they say the plans are part of an "evolving" process aimed at winning public confidence.
Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis said the government had failed to remove 250,000 failed asylum seekers from the UK and limits on economic migrants had been a "shambles".
Tony Blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no "magic bullet".
The Tories say Labour is acting too late while the Lib Dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system.
Ministers deny they have been spurred into action by Tory campaigning or because the prime minister is worried too little has been done.
Mr Clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants' families, and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants.
The prime minister on Sunday said immigration would be "toughened up" to ensure only those immigrants with skills the UK really needs will be granted work permits.

Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea.
The internationally recognised southern part of Cyprus is an EU member, but Turkey, which occupies northern Cyprus, had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country, calling the issue a "red line".
Turkey's involvement with the EU would provide an "invaluable bridge" between Europe and the rest of the world, Mr Howard added.
But the Tory leader argued that the EU constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as Turkey.
The deal, struck at the European Council last week, also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were "wrong", Mr Blair said.
It represented the achievement of an "historic British objective", he added.

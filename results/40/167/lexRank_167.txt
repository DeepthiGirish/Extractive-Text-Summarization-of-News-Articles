- The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities.
Housing plans criticised by MPs  "Irreversible environmental damage" will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east England, MPs have warned.
"Sustainable communities" were being promoted without a real understanding of what "sustainable" means, the Environmental Audit Committee said.
It said issues like energy needs and transport were not properly addressed.
He said: "We are working across government, especially with our colleagues at Defra, to create cleaner, safer and greener communities, while protecting and enhancing the environment."
The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low.
Regulations designed to ensure energy-efficient buildings are too lax, and builders routinely flout them anyway, it said.

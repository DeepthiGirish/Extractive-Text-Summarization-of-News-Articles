"However, all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals.
The accusation came after it emerged a Devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to "chase away unwanted animals" from his farm.
Mr Bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain.
North Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw was put in touch with the Middle Way Group, of which Mr Opik is a co-chairman, after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry, Defra.
Because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting.
Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.
Tory MP Peter Luff, another co-chairman of Middle Way, said that the legislation was "so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence".
"If all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer, then nobody can define that as hunting."

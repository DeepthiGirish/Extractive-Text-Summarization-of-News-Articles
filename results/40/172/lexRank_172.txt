Faith schools citizenship warning  Schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer, says the education watchdog.
Independent faith schools were singled out by Ofsted chief, David Bell, for not doing enough to promote the "wider tenets of British society".
Mr Bell said Muslim, Jewish and Evangelical Christian schools must be "intolerant of intolerance".
Diversity "certainly must not mean segregated or separate", he said.
Mr Bell's speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.
Badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by Mr Bell, and in a speech to the Hansard Society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values.

Councils 'must find Gypsy sites'  Ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers, amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments.
"The result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites, causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the Gypsies and travellers.
Andrew Ryder, of the Traveller Law Reform Coalition, said: "We welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for Gypsies and travellers, so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored.
In their November report, MPs from the committee scrutinising the Office for the Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for housing, said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop.
More money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks, said housing minister Yvette Cooper.
Ms Cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places.
That scheme has paid out Â£25m in four years, with Â£8m available for 2005.
"There are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning Gypsy and traveller sites," said Ms Cooper.

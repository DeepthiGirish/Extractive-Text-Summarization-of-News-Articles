He said an enlarged 25-member EU needs a streamlined decision making process.
Tories attack EU asylum moves  David Blunkett has been accused of using the "politics of confusion" to disguise new EU immigration measures.
"The government is employing the politics of confusion - I think, deliberately," argued Mr Davis.
Under this scheme larger states such as Britain are expected to have more power than the smaller EU states.
"If we don't work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours," said Mr Oaten.
And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over.
The EU has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states.
He argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK.
"If we don't like what other EU countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the British people," he said.
"By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto."

UK aid to help the victims of the Asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from Africa, Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised.He added he would give new figures on the number of tsunami-related British deaths to the Commons on Monday.Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Friday that about 440 Britons were either dead or missing in the disaster.Mr Blair told Sunday's programme: "Since Jack Straw gave those figures a couple of days ago they haven't moved a great deal, which should give us some hope that we are beginning to reach the peak of the numbers.But the exact allocation could not be clarified until the World Bank had completed its assessment of the needs of the countries affected.But he pledged that Africa - which sees a "preventable" tsunami-size death toll every month from conflict, disease and poverty - would not be neglected.As Britain takes up its presidency of the G8 group of leading nations, Mr Blair said ministers had a big agenda for Africa.

Mr Griffin told the Independent the Tories' plans were "a definite move onto our turf".
He said he found BNP's policies "abhorrent" but he said the UK had to take a different approach to immigration, which he said was out of control.
But Mr Howard said he rejected the idea that the Tories and BNP appealed to the same voting instincts.
Asked if he would welcome BNP voters he told the BBC: "I don't want anybody to vote for these extremist parties".
He added, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "If you want good community relations in this country...then you have to have firm, fair immigration controls."
The Tories have promised an upper limit on the number of people allowed into Britain with the slogan: "It's not racist to impose limits on immigration".

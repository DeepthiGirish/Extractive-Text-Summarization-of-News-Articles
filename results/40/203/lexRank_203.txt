Ministers had hoped to get Â£900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted Â£349m.
That comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry.
"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and Â£40m of invoices remain unpaid," Mr Leigh said.
Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed.
Mr Leigh said being "better prepared" would also help avoid the need for "mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak".
He also said Defra had been "dreadfully slow" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.
It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak.
Public accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis.

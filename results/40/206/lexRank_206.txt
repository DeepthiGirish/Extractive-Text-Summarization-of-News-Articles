Blair's hope for Blunkett return  The events leading to David Blunkett's resignation must not "swept under the carpet", the Tories have warned.
On Wednesday Tony Blair said he hoped the former home secretary would serve again in government in the future.
Mr Blunkett quit in December after a probe linked him to the visa application of his ex-lover's nanny.
Mr Blair said he left "without a stain on his character" but Tory Dominic Grieve branded the way Mr Blunkett's office operated as "scandalous".

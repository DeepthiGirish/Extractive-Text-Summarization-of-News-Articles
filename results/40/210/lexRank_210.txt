The strike also affected the Welsh assembly building in Cardiff Bay, where only pass-holders were allowed in.
"People like pensioners need a face-to-face service not an impersonal service on the phone which is what they want to impose."
Across Wales, pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including Cardiff, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Wrexham.
It is not about specific issues local to Wales or the assembly.
Pickets were in place across Wales, with protests around the country.
The strike, called by the Public and Commercial Services Union, was the biggest by civil servants in a decade.
The action follows Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in July that 104,000 jobs would be cut, with around 6,000 of those expected in Wales.
The worst-affected area in Wales will be the Department of Work and Pensions where 2,000 jobs are threatened.
Gordon Brown issued a defiant statement about the strike, saying the action would not affect the government's "determination" to make savings in order to increase investment in healthcare, education, transport and the fight against crime.
"Our decisions mean more police, more teachers, more doctors and more nurses," he said.
"We will provide help with information, relocation and retraining to help staff move into frontline work within the public sector, but we will not be diverted from these necessary changes so that we can make this essential investment."

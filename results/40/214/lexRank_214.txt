Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: "Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.
The committee also highlighted "deeply worrying" cases of children and young people taking their own lives.
The joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems.
Members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals.
The report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate "amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group".
Many of those who ended up taking their own lives had "presented themselves" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said.
It questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided.
Increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term, the report said.

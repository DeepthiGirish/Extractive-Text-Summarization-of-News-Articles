Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge.
Several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.
But critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services.
Ministers 'naive' over phone-taps  The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says.
Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other European countries.
But Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases.
Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: "[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it.
"It would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal."

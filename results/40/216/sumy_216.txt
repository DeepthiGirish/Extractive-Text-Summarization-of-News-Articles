Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge.Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: "[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it.Mr Solana's comments come the day after Sir Ian Blair, the newly-appointed Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.Under the Anti-Terrorism Crimes and Security Act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in British jails without trial or charge.The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance.But Mr Clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after Law Lords ruled it illegal.He has opted for a system of "control orders" whereby suspects, both British and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance.While accepting that people "have to be prepared" for a possible terrorist attack, Mr Solana said he had "qualms" about the home secretary's new plans.

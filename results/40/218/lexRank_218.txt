And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down.
During the interview Mr Blair also said the former home secretary David Blunkett would play a "big role" at the general election.
I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't.
"What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country."
Former welfare minister Frank Field MP said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so.
Blair dismisses quit claim report  Tony Blair has dismissed reports he told Gordon Brown he would quit before the next general election.
According to a new book, Brown's Britain, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.
The book, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston and serialised in the newspaper, said the pair had "mutual animosity and contempt" for each other.
It claims Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party.
But he then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.
"What the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity.
"I think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright, but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership."

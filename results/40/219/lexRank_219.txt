The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive.
Ms Jamieson praised the police for their action and said: "The police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them.
Ms Jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers.
Praising Celtic and Rangers for their efforts, she said: "I don't think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs.
"Both Rangers and Celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce, for example, an educational pack for young people."
Jamieson issues warning to bigots  Scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them "where it hurts most" by banning them from matches.
"That is the kind of thing we want to stop and that's the kind of thing supporters' groups are very clear they don't want to be part of either, and they will work with us to try and deal with that."
Cathy Jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the Scottish Executive campaign against sectarianism.

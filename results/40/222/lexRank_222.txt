Voters 'reject EU by two to one'  British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.
The Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour.
However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow.
Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution.
Another 7% said they would not vote at all.
The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006.

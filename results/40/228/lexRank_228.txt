The poster shows the two men's faces superimposed on winged pigs and says "the day the Tory sums add up".
Labour pig poster 'anti-Semitic'  The Labour Party has been accused of anti-Semitism over a poster depicting Michael Howard and Oliver Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs.
Labour said the poster was "not anti-Jewish, but anti-Tory".
A Conservative Party spokesman said: "While the Conservatives are concentrating on the issues that matter to people, such as lower taxes and controlled immigration, it is clear to see that the Labour Party is not.
Prospective Tory candidate Andrew Mennear, whose Finchley constituency contains a large Jewish community, branded it "tasteless" and offensive.
It is one of four designs e-mailed to Labour members, who were asked to vote for their favourite.
Mr Mennear, who was sent the e-mail by a friend, said he had been "shocked" by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified.

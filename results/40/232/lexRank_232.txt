Probe launched on Ken Nazi jibe  An investigation by the Standards Board is under way following allegations that Ken Livingstone has brought his office into disrepute.

The local government watchdog also said the allegation related to a failure to respect others.
It has the power to suspend or bar Labour's Mr Livingstone from office.
A complaint was made to the body by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Commission for Racial Equality.

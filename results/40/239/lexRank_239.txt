But the government said the move would help police "build safe communities".
Police Federation chairman Jan Berry said civilian officers should act as "eyes and ears" for the police.
"While the answer is a lot more real police, the government wants to recruit 25,000 people who can't arrest anyone," he said.
The federation said CSOs do not have the experience, training and safety equipment to deal with "potentially confrontational" situations.
"They should not be placed in potentially confrontational situations - which detaining someone clearly is," she said.
The powers will be granted by chief constables of local forces.
Ms Berry said this "dramatically changes" their original purpose - to be a visible presence combating low-level crime and anti-social behaviour.
She said more powers would mean more paperwork and less time on the street.
She denied their role was changing and said the new powers would not take them away from the streets.

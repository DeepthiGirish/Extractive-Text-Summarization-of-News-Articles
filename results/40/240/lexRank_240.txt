Sport betting rules in spotlight  A group of MPs and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport.
The Parliamentary Group on Betting and Gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year.
It followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport, such as that done using the internet and mobile phones, has led to more cheating.
The all-party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting.
They include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years.
Lord Condon, head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit, who originally made the call for longer prison sentences, said the two-year penalty was "derisory".

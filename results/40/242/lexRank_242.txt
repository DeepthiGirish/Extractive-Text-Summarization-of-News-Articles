Whitehall shredding increasing - Tories  Civil servants have drastically stepped up the shredding of official documents, figures compiled by the Tories suggest.
Dr Lewis has called for an investigation by the information commissioner Richard Thomas.
Liberal Democrat Alan Beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the Department of Constitutional Affairs - said if the claims were true, Whitehall was "acting entirely against the spirit of the new Act".
Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served "no current purpose", Mr Thomas said.
A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records".
Some government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the Freedom of Information Act's implementation on 1 January.
Departments for defence, environment and trade, which had all increased file destruction, said they were following rules governing public records.
The Freedom of Information Act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years.
But BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of Whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins.

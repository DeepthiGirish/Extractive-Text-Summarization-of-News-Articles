No election TV debate, says Blair  Tony Blair has said he will not take part in a TV debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election.
"We answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons I have given before, the answer is no," he said at his monthly news conference.
In October Tory leader Michael Howard said Mr Blair would be running scared if he refused calls to go head-to-head.

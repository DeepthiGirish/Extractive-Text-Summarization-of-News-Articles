And they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison.
Could rivalry overshadow election?
Tony Blair will seek to reassure Labour MPs on Monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at Westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which Gordon Brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.
And it matters little whether the rift is real or, as some try to suggest, simply the product of newspaper headlines and Westminster gossip.
Meanwhile the likes of Health Secretary John Reid and Labour peer Lord Haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue.
Mr Blair talked about the "New" Labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label.
For his part, Mr Brown insists his only motivation was to get Labour re-elected.
Along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues, they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of Britain.
It is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift.
Ian Gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring: "For goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can."
Those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re-election.
But this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage.
They believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears.
For example, the weekend's attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick.

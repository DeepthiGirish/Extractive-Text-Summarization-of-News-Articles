Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.

Labour seeks to quell feud talk  Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.
Mr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair.
A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes.
The event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role.
But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task.

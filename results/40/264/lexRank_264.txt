With an election looming the next big speech from Gordon Brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and, in particular, the use of that little three letter word.
Under what is to be the general election slogan "Britain is working", the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour.
That might get under the skin of Mr Brown, but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post-war chancellor Britain has had.
Every family - not just the fortunate few - knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood.
"The highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions".
That poll may still be about 16 weeks away, but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing.
There was a detailed account of the government's past record, with a major emphasis on the economy and public services.
There was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with Chancellor Gordon Brown.
And there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly "New" Labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.
There was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges, although the prime minister talked about a "New Labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society".

Ms Khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife.
Despite her concerns, Ms Khan dubbed herself a "hope-monger", saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges.
"Public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups," she said.
In a lecture at the London School of Economics, Irene Khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 September, 2001.
She said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message.
And it had to fight poverty, not just focus on political rights for elites.
Ms Khan highlighted detentions without trial, including those at the US camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems.
"What's a new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war," she said.
"By using the language of war, human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war."

With the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, Mr Kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation.
Similarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dem approach to asylum and immigration, with Mr Kennedy stressing politicians should not "foment an artificial debate" about immigration and attacking Michael Howard's proposals for quotas.
Lib Dems' 'bold' election policy  Charles Kennedy has told voters his Liberal Democrats will offer them an "honest choice" at the next general election.
It is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the Lib Dems and the other two.
With his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack.
Now he is promising to levy a "modest" increase of the same amount on earnings over Â£100,000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges.
They are to scrap student fees, finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax.
That last policy will also see about 3% of the most well off paying more while others, pensioners in particular, will pay less.

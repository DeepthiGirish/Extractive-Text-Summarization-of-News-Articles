"I accepted the kind invitation to enter the House of Lords as a working peer for practical political reasons," he said when his peerage was first announced.
During his induction into the Upper House, Lord Kinnock was accompanied by Lords Leader Baroness Amos and Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, a former aide to the ex-Labour leader.
After a brief career as a tutor for the Workers' Educational Association, he became an MP at the age of just 28 for his home seat of Bedwellty (later Islwyn).
Lord Kinnock - who led Labour from 1983 until 1992 - was until recently one of Britain's EU commissioners.
A former critic of the House of Lords, he has said he will use the Upper House to advocate its reform and to talk on issues like higher education.
"It is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education, sustainable transport, industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns, particularly poverty and oppression."
It has been a long journey for the new Lord Kinnock from his earliest days as a rebellious youngster in the south Wales valleys.
Born in 1942 in Tredegar to a miner father and nurse mother, he attended Lewis Boys' School in nearby Pengam, known then as the "Eton of the valleys".

'Super union' merger plan touted  Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a "super union" of two million members.
The move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers.
Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000.
Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership.

The Lib Dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax.
Other parties have accused the Lib Dems of making uncosted promises.
Those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s, putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks, he said.
The Lib Dems say the Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of its tax rises.
A day ahead of the government's pre-Budget report, Mr Kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to "painful economic realities".
Mr Kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation.
He said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners.
Now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees, providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down.
"With the stealth tax strategy of Gordon Brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the Conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down."
The Lib Dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and Wednesday's speech did not announce new policies.

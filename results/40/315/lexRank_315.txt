It is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than Â£720m, while a further Â£947m has been designated as "unrecoverable".
But committee member and Tory MP Nigel Waterson said he was "amazed" Mr Smith was still in his job.
"No date was ever given for Doug Smith's departure," she said adding that the post had been advertised.
Doug Smith's departure was announced by Work Secretary Alan Johnson on 17 November as MPs grilled him over the agency's poor performance.
In November, when he surprised MPs and the watching media by announcing Mr Smith's departure, Mr Johnson said: "I should tell you that Doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead.
"Doug has exceeded the four years that senior civil servants are now expected to remain in a particular post.
In January the MPs who make up the Commons Work and Pensions Committee published a highly critical report into the "failing" agency noting the chief executive "has now left" and hoping "the new leadership will bring a fresh approach to what is a failing organisation".
Asked on Thursday about Mr Smith's position Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's World at One he thought it was a "non-story".
A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman confirmed Mr Smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found.
He added his committee was "duty bound" to allow the work and pensions secretary to get new management into place in the CSA and it would be "premature" to say anything further on the issue at the moment.
His "resignation" was referred to by both Tory and Lib Dem leaders during that day's prime ministers questions.

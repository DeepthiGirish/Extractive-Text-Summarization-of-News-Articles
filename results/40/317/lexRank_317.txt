Parties' plans for council tax  Anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12.9%.
Pensioners' protests spread - some marched, others simply refused to pay the increase.
The rate would be set locally, but administered by the Inland Revenue which they say would save at least Â£300m.
Some, such as 83-year-old Elizabeth Winkfield, said they would rather go to jail.
The Audit Commission found the whole local government finance system was "fundamentally flawed" and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.
Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient.
They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a Â£100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down.
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be "radical reform".
The party says this year's increases will be the lowest in a decade.

"I think all-black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates," Mr Vishwanathan said.
Labour in constituency race row  Labour's choice of a white candidate for one of the UK's most multi-racial seats proves the need for all-black short lists, says a race group.
Local councillor Lyn Brown was selected for West Ham, east London, in a contest between two white and five ethnic minority women.
However, Labour has so far unable been unable to comment on the implications of the West Ham result.
Ashok Vishwanathan of Operation Black Vote, which aims to increase ethnic minorities' participation in the political process and their representation, said the result again showed all-women shortlists were not effective in getting minority women selected.

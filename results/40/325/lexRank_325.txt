Damian Hockney, now Veritas deputy leader, and Peter Hulme-Cross were elected in 2004 on the list system.
Mr Hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the GLA as it did for other electoral list systems.
"The Greater London Act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list, their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party."
Veritas was formed by Mr Kilroy-Silk earlier this month after he quit UKIP following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.
UKIP could sue Veritas defectors  The UK Independence Party could take legal action to unseat two London Assembly members who defected to Robert Kilroy Silk's Veritas Party.
The party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as UKIP representatives, not as individuals.

The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: "2+2=5".
Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: "It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches."
Mr Temko said he blamed "cock-up not conspiracy", saying he did not detect inherent anti-Semitism in any of the parties' election campaigns.
The poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election.
Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies.
A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row.
But a Conservative spokeswoman said: "This poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by Labour's campaign team."
The image prompted concern from the editor of the Jewish Chronicle but Labour insists it is simply anti-Tory.
Jewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image.
The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued.

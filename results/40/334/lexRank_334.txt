Immigration to be election issue  Immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time.
But no longer.
Both Labour and the Tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns.
They have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues, with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes.
That was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue.
But it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or, alternatively, running scared of addressing the problem.
But this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies.

Kennedy begins pre-election tour  Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has begun a week-long tour to persuade voters they are the "real opposition".
On Tuesday Mr Kennedy will visit Leicester South, where Lib Dem MP Parmjit Singh Gill overturned a big Labour majority to win the seat in last year's by-election.
Speaking to the BBC's Westminster Hour on Sunday, Mr Kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 May - would be much more unpredictable than any others in "recent experience".
But he brushed off Labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the Tories in "by the back door".
Mr Kennedy is visiting constituencies in Somerset and Hampshire on Monday - rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the Conservatives.
Later he will visit places, such as Liverpool, where Labour is targeted.
Stops in Shrewsbury, North Dorset, Liverpool, Manchester, Basingstoke and west London are planned for later in the week.

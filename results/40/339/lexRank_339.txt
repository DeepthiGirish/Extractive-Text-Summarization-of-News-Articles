All the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run-up to the election after a survey suggested first-time buyers could not afford a home in 92% of UK towns.
The Lib Dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites.
When they moved house, they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share.
There are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities.
Lib Dems target first-time buyers  The Liberal Democrats have unveiled plans to build 100,000 new "affordable" homes on publicly owned land.
People would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land, he added.
Party leader Charles Kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government.
They would spend about 30% of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property.
Mr Kennedy said: "Mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually, investing only as much as they can afford."
The kind of "golden share" used by the Lib Dems in South Shropshire could be rolled out more widely.
But the plans involve changing the VAT system, which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings.

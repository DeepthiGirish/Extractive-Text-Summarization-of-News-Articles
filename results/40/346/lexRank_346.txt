Mr Milburn, in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning, explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe Labour and Tony Blair are the future while Michael Howard and the Tories would take the country backwards.
And Tony Blair would be in the very front line of that campaign, he said.
Labour's four little words  Labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which, for those just returned from the planet Galifray, is "looming".
The slogan "Britain forward not back" (no, it's not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary Time Lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it's always there but we mostly stop noticing.
The word "Britain" is cast on a red background - a nod to Old Labour.
"Forward" is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and, along with "not back", is set against a mushy pea green background.
As one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared, it was all very post modern, or something.
Great use of colour.

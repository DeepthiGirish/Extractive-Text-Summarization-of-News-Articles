'UK will stand firm on EU rebate'  Britain's Â£3bn EU rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week's European Council summit, Jack Straw said.
The foreign secretary told MPs the rebate, secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, was "entirely justified".
New European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the EU budget.
Mr Straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation EU still had to "see the light" on the rebate.
But the foreign secretary told the Commons foreign affairs committee: "Our position is very clear: it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation."

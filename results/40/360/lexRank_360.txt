Will the Budget bring out smiling voters?
As Tory spokesman Oliver Letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners, wouldn't he.
And everyone does, indeed, expect Gordon Brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 May.
There will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways.
But Mr Brown will stun Westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters' faces and make them more inclined to back Labour in the election.
And there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week's Budget.
The aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core Labour voters in the fold, while ensuring the middle England voters who gave Tony Blair two election victories don't desert him at the third poll.
And, needless to say, there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the Budget will have on Mr Brown's own ambitions to replace Mr Blair as prime minister at some point after a third win.

Chancellor Gordon Brown said 12,500 jobs had gone while 7,800 were being moved out of the South East.
Mr Brown also announced plans to merge 35 agencies into nine - described by one civil service union as a "bonfire of the quangos".
Mark Serwotka, the leader of the Public and Commercial Services Union said: "In last year's budget we had the day of the long knifes as the chancellor kicked off the crude game of who could cut the most civil service jobs between the government and the Tories.
He said Mr Brown had made welcome announcements on closing tax loopholes and extending the New Deal, while cutting "the very people who deliver them."
Whitehall cuts 'ahead of target'  Thousands of civil service jobs have already been cut or moved out of London as part of a major cost-cutting drive.
He plans to axe 104,000 jobs to free up money for education, health, defence, housing and overseas aid.

He called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $20 each, thereby boosting the market for inoculations.
The charity's head of HIV/Aids in Britain, Simon Wright said: "While encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an HIV vaccine is important, a failure to provide any funding for HIV treatments condemns a generation of people to death.
"The UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion (Â£27bn).
A doubling of world aid to halve world poverty."
Brown calls for Â£5.5bn Aids fund  Gordon Brown has called on rich nations to fund a Â£5.5bn ($10bn) plan to fight the Aids epidemic and find a vaccine.
On the fourth day of his six-day tour of Africa, the UK chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges.
He hopes to use the UK's G8 presidency to push the issue forward.
"I believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat, cure and eradicate the world's deadliest disease of today - and today the world's least curable disease - HIV/Aids - will rightly earn the title 'the great generation'," Mr Brown said in a speech during his African tour.
The problems of HIV/Aids were inseparable from poverty, he added.
"At least $10 billion per annum (Â£5.5bn) is needed to address the HIV/Aids crisis in low and middle income countries.

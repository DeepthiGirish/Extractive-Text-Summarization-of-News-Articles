Howard pitches for UK ethnic vote  Michael Howard is to make a pitch for Britain's ethnic vote urging people who feel "taken for granted" by Tony Blair to vote Conservative.
He will say Conservatives "share the same values" as the UK's minorities.
And that he wants to build a "better Britain" where everyone, whatever the colour of their skin or religion, can "make the most of their talents".
But the Tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is "outdated and unjust".
"It sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities," he will argue.
Mr Howard - himself the son of immigrants - will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the UK.

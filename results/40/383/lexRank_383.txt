Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a "level playing field" on immigration and asylum controls.
Change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets, he argued.
Labour accused of 'EU propaganda'  A "taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise" on the EU is being used to lull the British public into a false sense of security, say the Tories.
Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution.
His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Tories of "running scared" of debate.
Mr Straw used Thursday's Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005.
Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw.
Africa and climate change would also feature highly.
He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe's economic output and were spent "where it adds most value".
Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was "fully justified".
"We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area," he said.

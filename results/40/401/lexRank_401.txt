Mr Blair has so far resisted calls for him to name the day but all parties have stepped up campaigning recently.
Mr Marr said on Wednesday's Today programme: "There's almost nobody at a senior level inside the government or in Parliament itself who doesn't expect the election to be called on 4 or 5 April.
Downing Street would not be drawn on the claim, saying election timing was a matter for the prime minister.
A Number 10 spokeswoman would only say: "He will announce an election when he wants to announce an election."
The move will signal a frantic week at Westminster as the government is likely to try to get key legislation through Parliament.

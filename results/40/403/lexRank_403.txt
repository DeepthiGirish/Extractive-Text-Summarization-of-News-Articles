Voters 'don't trust politicians'  Eight out of 10 voters do not trust politicians to tell the truth, a new poll conducted for the BBC suggests.
And 87% of the 1,000 adults quizzed by ICM for BBC News 24 said politicians did not deliver what they promised.
Both the Tories and the Lib Dems are keen to emphasise a perceived lack of trust in Tony Blair, following his claims over Iraqi weapons.
She said she did not feel her own colleagues could be trusted, but suggested the "three-cornered relationship" between the press, politicians and the public had a hand in the issue.
The poll comes after Foreign Secretary Jack Straw predicted trust would be "the key choice" at the next election.
But according to the BBC poll, 61% said the issue of trust made no difference to whether or not they would vote at the next election, widely expected on 5 May.
Some 87% said politicians did not keep the promises they made before elections, while 92% said they never gave "a straight answer".
Just under three-quarters of respondents (73%) said politicians had shown themselves to be dishonest too often.
Mr Straw told activists in Blackburn on Thursday that voters would have to decide at the next election which party "best deserves" their "future trust".

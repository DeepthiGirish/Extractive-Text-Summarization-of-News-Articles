It is the latest hefty donation to the party by the billionaire - he has contributed more than Â£10m since 1999.
David Sainsbury said he was pleased to give cash to a party that had the "vision" to deliver economic prosperity and better public services for Britain.
General Secretary Matt Carter said it was "a fantastic gift" that would help Labour "fight and win the election".
"Through the generosity of David Sainsbury and other Labour supporters, Labour will be campaigning hard to take Britain forward and to stop the Tories taking us back," Mr Carter said.

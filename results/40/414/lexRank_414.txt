Speaking amid a flurry of pre-election campaigning, the prime minister said: "I am an issue, I always will be.
He pledged to clamp down on Britain's growing compensation culture, which has brought concerns that doctors, teachers and other professionals are being hampered in their work by the fear of frivolous lawsuits.
Blair 'up for it' ahead of poll  Tony Blair says his personal standing in the eyes of voters will be "an issue" in the general election.
He told The Observer government life was a "constant barrage of attack" but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute.
He said Britain was in danger of needless panic over public safety issues.
He added: "If you are afraid to take criticism, you should go and do another job."
Asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to Labour, he said: "It's important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute."
Whether he still had something to offer, he said, was a judgement for people to make.
Mr Blair's assessment is likely to be seen as a signal that replacing him would not bring an upsurge in fortunes for the Labour administration.

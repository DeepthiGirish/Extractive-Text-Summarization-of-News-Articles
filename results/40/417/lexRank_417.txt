All the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in May, although Prime Minister Tony Blair has not confirmed any timing.
"We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party," he said.
Unveiling the slogan at the party's spring conference, he said there was no "glass ceiling" to its ambitions.
He told delegates that Labour had abused the public's trust and that the Tories had failed to oppose them.
In response, the Conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the "forgotten majority".
Speaking in Harrogate Mr Kennedy said: "People want a credible, principled political party which offers a different vision of what Britain can be."
Only the Liberal Democrats stood against the Iraq war, he said, and they had also provided strong opposition to the government's plans on ID cards, anti-terror measures and taxation.
He said: "If you voted Conservative in 2001 ... what good did it do you?
Your vote was wasted.
"What people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister."
